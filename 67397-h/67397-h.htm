</div>


<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the sales
of magazines have increased tremendously
during the past five or six years, the popularity
of a good paper-covered novel,
printed in attractive and convenient form,
remains undiminished.</p>

<p>There are thousands of readers who do
not care for magazines because the stories
in them, as a rule, are short and just about
the time they become interested in it, it
ends and they are obliged to readjust their
thoughts to a set of entirely different
characters.</p>

<p>The S. &amp; S. novel is long and complete
and enables the reader to spend many
hours of thorough enjoyment without doing
any mental gymnastics. Our paper-covered
books stand pre-eminent among
up-to-date fiction. Every day sees a new
copyrighted title added to the S. &amp; S.
lines, each one making them stronger,
better and more invincible.</p>

<p>Letters of congratulation have been showered upon us from all

announced that Mr. Cook wrote all of these stories, it would have

<p>The reason is that Mr. Cook is a widely traveled man and has,
therefore, been enabled to lay the plot of one of his stories in the
&#8220;land of little rain,&#8221; another on the high seas, another in Spain
and Spanish America, and to write a railroad story that a reader
of thirty years&#8217; experience decided must have been written by a
veteran railroad man. If stories of vigorous adventure are wanted,
stories that are drawn true to life and give that thrill which all
really good fiction ought to give, the books listed here are what

<small>A BOY WITH A TEMPER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Danny Chatterton came up the street whistling a merry
tune, while Don Scott lay under an apple-tree back of his
father&#8217;s house, munching an apple and scowling blackly,
although the September afternoon was pleasant and
sunny enough to put any boy in an agreeable humor.
Judging by the sour expression on Don&#8217;s face one might
never have fancied the half-devoured apple in his hand
was sweet.</p>

<p>Spying the boy beneath the tree, Danny stopped, leaned
on the fence, and called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Scotty! What you dud-dud-dud-doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see?&#8221; growled the boy addressed. &#8220;I&#8217;m eating
an apple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dud-does it hu-hurt ye much?&#8221; grinned the cheerful
lad at the fence. &#8220;What do you eat it for if it makes you
fur-fur-feel so bad?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Don&#8217;s answer to this bit of persiflage was a still blacker
scowl and sullen silence. Danny kicked the fence and
whistled, a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, gimme an apple,&#8221; he entreated. &#8220;You&#8217;ll mum-mum-mum-make
yourself sus-sick trying to eat the ho-ho-whole
of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy under the tree picked up an apple and threw
it viciously at the sarcastic fellow outside the fence, who
caught it with one hand, crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Judgment! Out! Gug-gug-great work!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he gave the apple a wipe on his jacket and took
a trial bite out of it, his manner being suspicious till he
had tested it, upon which his face betrayed satisfaction
and he immediately took a still larger bite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ji-ji-ji-jimminy!&#8221; he stuttered, speaking with his
mouth full and chewing and talking at the same time.
&#8220;It&#8217;s sus-sus-sweet! I never knew that was a sus-sweet
apple tut-tut-tree, and I thought it must be sus-sour or
bub-bub-bitter from the way you looked. If I&#8217;d
known&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better not come round here for apples after dark,&#8221;
grimly warned Don. &#8220;Pat sleeps over the kitchen, and
his window looks right out onto this orchard. He&#8217;s got a
gun loaded with rock-salt, and he&#8217;d shoot just as quick as
he&#8217;d take a drink of water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case,&#8221; grinned Danny, &#8220;judgin&#8217; by the
cuc-cuc-color of his nose, there ain&#8217;t no great danger that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
he&#8217;ll ever dud-do any sus-sus-sus-shooting. But say, ain&#8217;t
you coming up to the field for pup-pup-practice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>Don replied in such a short, savage manner that Chatterton
paused with his mouth stuffed full and stared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Wh-why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a gug-good reason, but it ain&#8217;t mum-mum-much
of an explanation. We cuc-cuc-can&#8217;t do our bub-best
without the whole eleven, and we&#8217;ve got to pup-put
in some hot pup-practice if we expect to cuc-cuc-cut any
ice with them Ha-Highlanders next Saturday. Sterndale
will lul-look for every mum-man this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him look and be hanged!&#8221; snapped Don, sitting
up and clasping one knee with both hands. &#8220;He&#8217;ll find
out there is one fellow who won&#8217;t stand to be called a
chump and a duffer by that cheap city dude, Renwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Danny threw the apple-core backward over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Renwood is our cuc-cuc-coach, you know,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;He knows all abub-bub-bub-about playing football.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says he does, but I don&#8217;t believe he knows half as
much as he pretends to, and I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s a great bluffer.
Anyhow, he can&#8217;t shoot off his mouth at me. What&#8217;s the
matter with Sterndale? He&#8217;s captain, but he permits this
Renwood to run things. He makes me sick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s what ails ye, is it? I knew it was sus-sus-something.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
You gug-gug-gug-got mad because Renwood
mum-made some talk to ye when you fur-fur-fumbled his
pass last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t fumble it!&#8221; snarled Don. &#8220;He was to blame
himself, for he didn&#8217;t pass it right, and then he tried to
lay it all on to me. I won&#8217;t take that kind of talk from
anybody, I don&#8217;t care who it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bub-bub-bub-but the rest of us have to tut-tut-take it,&#8221;
chattered Danny. &#8220;He even gave Sus-Sterndale a bub-bub-brushing
up abub-bout his kicking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the more fools you for standing it! Just because
he&#8217;s lived in Boston and played football on Boston
Common, he takes us for a lot of chumps down here. No
stuck-up city chap can lord it over me, and don&#8217;t you forget
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s our coach!&#8221; said Danny, again. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
know much about fuf-fuf-football, and he knows everything.
Highland has a reg&#8217;ler college player for a cuc-cuc-coach,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. He doesn&#8217;t play with the Highlanders;
he only coaches them; and he knows his business. If
we had such a fellow as that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d get mum-mum-mad the first tut-time he tut-talked
straight to ye. You&#8217;re always gug-gug-gettin&#8217;
mad and sus-sulking so you sus-sus-spoil everything you
go into. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s the mum-mum-matter with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don sprang to his feet, his face turning pale and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
eyes gleaming. With his hands clenched, he advanced
toward the fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You better go along about your business, Chatterton!&#8221;
he grated. &#8220;I won&#8217;t take that kind of talk from you,
either! You can run your old football team without me,
and you&#8217;re all a lot of soft-headed chumps to let Renwood
lord it over you. Now, don&#8217;t make any back talk to me!
Go on and tell them what I think of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Danny backed away from the fence and sidled off, as
Don came forward threateningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but we&#8217;ll get along bub-bub-better without
ye,&#8221; he declared, with a taunting grin. &#8220;You&#8217;re always
rah-rah-raising a rah-rah-row.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don had reached the fence, and, in a sudden burst of
rage, he tore off a broken picket and flung it after Danny,
who skillfully dodged the missile and then hastily scudded
away, still laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right&mdash;run!&#8221; snarled Don, glaring after the little
fellow. &#8220;If I had hold of you, I&#8217;d make ye laugh out
of the other corner of your mouth!&#8221;</p>

<p>He kicked the fence savagely, and then retreated to the
apple-tree once more, in anything but an agreeable humor.</p>

<p>Pat, the Irish hostler and man about the place, came
round to the front of the house, leading Dr. Scott&#8217;s horse,
attached to a light driving carriage. The doctor, medicine-case
in hand, appeared at the front door; but, instead of
descending the walk and entering the carriage at once, he
came down the steps and turned into the orchard back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
of the house, where his son was still sulking under the
sweet apple-tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; said the doctor, a gravely handsome man
with iron-gray beard and dark eyes, which now seemed
strangely sad, &#8220;sitting there at my window just now, I
happened to overhear your conversation with that other
lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don flushed a little, but continued to scowl, though he
had risen to his feet and was standing in a respectful attitude
of attention before his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;I noted,&#8221; said the gentleman, &#8220;that you were in a very
bad humor, and your words told me why you were angry.
I also observed that you flew into an unreasonable passion
at the close of your talk. Now I am not going to lecture
you, Don, but I wish to warn you. You must learn to
govern your temper, my son, or it will control you, to
your sorrow and everlasting regret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father, there are times when it&#8217;s impossible not
to become angry,&#8221; protested the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it may seem so, but every time a person gives
way to a fit of anger he weakens his self-control and
makes himself less capable of successfully coping with the
trials and emergencies of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don made a swift, impatient gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help getting mad!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s no use for
me to try to restrain my temper; I have tried, and I can&#8217;t
do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shows how much your will-power is weakened already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
when you make such a confession,&#8221; said the doctor,
regretfully. &#8220;I once thought the same about myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You, father?&#8221; exclaimed the boy, in surprise. &#8220;Why,
I never knew you to lose your temper. I didn&#8217;t suppose&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I was taught to control my passions at any
cost, and a bitter lesson it was, my son. When I have
noted how quick and choleric you are, I have sometimes
been tempted to tell you the whole sad story, but it is
something of which I do not like to think or speak, and so
I have refrained. Perhaps I will do so some day; but,
in the meantime, I urge you, Don, to struggle with yourself
to get the mastery of your temper at any cost, which
I sincerely hope may never bring to you such sorrow as
an act of mine, done in a moment of anger, brought upon
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor spoke with such earnestness that Don was
greatly impressed, and he immediately promised:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try, father&mdash;I&#8217;ll try, though I am afraid I cannot
succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can and must, my boy. Be sure you have my
sympathy, for I know you inherited your passionate temperament
from me. Do not fear to come to me for sympathy
and encouragement any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>With those words, the doctor turned away, leaving Don
standing there beneath the tree, watching him depart. The
gentleman entered his carriage, and, with a wave of one
gloved hand to his son, drove away. Don followed the retreating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
figure with his eyes till it disappeared from view,
and then he earnestly murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem possible that he ever could know what
it is to be really and truly angry, for he is the best and
kindest father in the whole world. For his sake I&#8217;ll do
my best to control my temper&mdash;I&#8217;ll do my best.&#8221;</p>

<small>ANOTHER BOY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Don&#8217;s musings were broken in upon by a familiar voice,
which cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello there, old man! What&#8217;s the matter with you&mdash;in
a trance? Come out of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking up, Don saw Leon Bentley stopping outside
the fence. As usual, Leon was smoking a cigarette. He
was dressed in a padded football suit, with his cap set
rakishly over one ear, and his manner was that of one
possessed of unlimited conceit and an overwhelming sense
of his own importance.</p>

<p>Don had never liked Bentley but his dislike had not
been particularly noticeable, for he was a fellow who, on
account of his quick temper and sulky moods, had few
associates and no close companions among the boys of
the village.</p>

<p>Bentley had a strong taste for flashy clothes and cheap
jewelry, being inclined to swagger and boast and use profane
language, so it was not strange that any thoroughly self-respecting
boy in the village did not care to be regarded
as his intimate friend.</p>

<p>At one time close friendship had seemed to exist between
Leon and Rob Linton, a lad whose bullying inclinations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
had caused him to be disliked secretly by those
who openly professed admiration and regard for him; but
even Linton, awakened at last to his own faults, sickened
of Bentley and fell to avoiding him as far as possible,
which left Leon casting about for another associate.</p>

<p>Remembering the words of his father and his own resolution
to try to control his temper, even though Linton&#8217;s
free-and-easy manner around within him a feeling of resentment,
Don held himself in check, nodded shortly, and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Bentley. Going to practice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; returned Leon, airily. &#8220;Got to do it, I
suppose, though it&#8217;s a horrid bore. Fellow has to practice
to keep in the swim and be a real athlete; and he
has to be an athlete nowadays, or take part in athletic
sports, at least, in order to stand any show with the girls.
If he isn&#8217;t right in it they&#8217;ll throw him down for some
fellow who is, even though that fellow may be as long,
lank, awkward and clownish as that duffer John Smith.
Why, even a girl like Dora Deland, proud as she is, has
fallen to raving over him since he happened to turn out
something of a baseball pitcher. You must show your
skill, old man, if you hope to cut any figure with Zadia
Renwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bentley fell to laughing over his final words, as if he
regarded them as a good joke; but he stopped suddenly
as he saw Don step quickly toward the fence, scowling
his fiercest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;Have a care with that tongue of yours, Bentley!&#8221; Scott
almost snarled. &#8220;Because I happen to be acquainted with
Zadia Renwood does not give you license to make cheap
talk, and I won&#8217;t take it from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leon whistled softly, and then hastened to declare:</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean anything, Scott, so what&#8217;s the use to
flare up and get mad like that! You ought to take something
for that temper of yours. At the smallest spark
you go off like a flash of powder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don paused, and his flushed face suddenly began to
pale, for he realised how soon he had flown into a passion
after vowing to do his best to control his temper, which
filed him with shame and vexation over his own weakness.</p>

<p>With an effort, the boy cast out from his soul the anger
that had seized upon him, and he actually forced a faint
smile to his face, which made it seem rather handsome in
a dark and cloudy way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Bentley,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I was a fool to become
angry over your careless words, but neither Zadia
Renwood nor any other girl is anything to me, for you
know I dislike girls. They&#8217;re all silly creatures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They may be silly, but they&#8217;re sweet,&#8221; Bentley grinned,
in a manner that was decidedly repulsive to the other boy.
&#8220;I tell you, girls are great inventions, and I know you&#8217;d
like them, old man, if you&#8217;d just overcome your foolish
prejudice against them. And Zadia Renwood is a peach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
too! I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s struck on you, and you only have to
brace up&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Don stopped the speaker with a gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do, Bentley!&#8221; he exclaimed, harshly, holding
himself in check. &#8220;Even if I cared for girls, I&#8217;d steer
clear of Dolph Renwood&#8217;s sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like him?&#8221; questioned Leon, pulling out a
package of cigarettes and selecting one, which he proceeded
to roll gently between the palms of his hands, all
the while watching Don with a curious, cunning look in
his washed-out gray eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate the cad!&#8221; broke out Scott; but he suddenly
seemed to remember his failing and got a firm hold on
himself. &#8220;He puts on too many airs, Bentley, and he
makes a great bluff that he&#8217;s a football expert; but it
is my private opinion, which I am willing to express publicly,
that he doesn&#8217;t know the rudiments of the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so, too,&#8221; eagerly nodded the lad outside the
fence, as, with his yellow-stained fingers, he nervously
pulled a little of the filling from one end of the paper
wrapper. &#8220;And Sterndale is a fool to let that city fop
run things the way he does. Never knew Dick to be so
soft before, but I suppose we&#8217;ll have to stand it if we
wish to play the game. Come, it&#8217;s time we were on the
field now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don hesitated. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; he said, in an
unsettled manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, rats!&#8221; cried Leon, lighting the prepared cigarette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
from the stub of the one he had finished, which he tossed
aside. &#8220;Come along, Scott, for you&#8217;re needed, and it&#8217;s
your duty to play for the honor of Rockspur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By your own words a few moments ago, you confessed
that you are not going into the game for any such reason,
but simply to win admiration from the girls. I do not believe
any fellow who plays football for such a reason can
do his best and be of real value to the team.&#8221;</p>

<p>A suggestion of color mounted to the sallow cheeks of
the cigarette-smoker, and he laughingly retorted:</p>

<p>&#8220;That was talk, Scott; of course I&#8217;m going into the
game to help the home team win. We can&#8217;t afford to
lose any good man, and so you&#8217;ll come along with me.
As for Renwood, we&#8217;re not the only ones who are sick
of his high-handed style of lording it over us, and we may
be able to bring about a change, if we go at it in the right
manner. Get your suit and come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plainly undecided, Don leaned on the fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;My suit is in the dressing-room under the grand-stand,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I did make up my mind not to have
anything more to do with the team as long as Renwood
was coaching&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was when you were mad, old man. Of course, I
don&#8217;t blame you, but don&#8217;t let your temper cause you to go
back on your own town. Renwood doesn&#8217;t really belong
here, anyhow; he&#8217;s only just moved here since his father,
seeing that Rockspur is bound to become a famous summer
resort, has bought up the East Shore land as a speculation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
I don&#8217;t believe in letting such an outsider come
in and run things. If you and I combine against him, we
can bring enough of the others to our way of thinking to
set him back into the place where he belongs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don did not fancy the idea of forming such an alliance
with Bentley, but he sought to justify it by telling himself
that it was for the good of the Rockspur football team,
and that there was no harm in uniting with Leon on such
an issue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not become friendly with him,&#8221; thought Don, &#8220;simply
because we both think the same way about this matter.
A man is likely to find it needful to have business
relations with another whom he would not accept as an
associate, and this is purely a matter of business.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was soon to learn that such relations are always
to be avoided when possible, and that, justly or unjustly,
a man or a boy is judged by the company he keeps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; urged Leon. &#8220;We&#8217;ll talk it over on our
way to the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was angry I declared I wouldn&#8217;t play on the
team with Renwood,&#8221; Don mentally said; &#8220;but it is my
duty not to let my anger control me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, vaulting over the fence, he joined Bentley, and
they set off together toward the football field.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />


<small>THE FOOTBALL FIELD.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The Rockspur baseball ground, leveled and fenced
through the energies of Dick Sterndale, captain of the
village nine, was also to serve as a football field. Already
Sterndale and Renwood, assisted by others who
were interested and enthusiastic, had measured and lined
off the field and erected the goal-posts at each end.</p>

<p>The marked-off field was three hundred and thirty feet
long and one hundred and sixty feet in width. The
measurements had been obtained by the aid of a tape, and
then lime-lines had been drawn with a marker to indicate
the actual field of play. Outside this field and inside the
fence was a varying amount of room. At one point the
fence was only eight feet from the boundary of the playing
field, and this was the smallest permissible amount of
space.</p>

<p>Having obtained the outer boundaries of the playing
field, the tape was run down the side-lines and wooden
pegs were driven into the ground exactly five yards apart.
When the pegs were all down, the tape was stretched
across the field from a peg on one side to a corresponding
peg on the opposite side, and the lime marker was run
over the tape, so the field was marked off with twenty-one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
lines between the ends, or twenty-three lines if the end
lines were included.</p>

<p>Then the fifth line out from the end, or the twenty-five
yard line, the point of kick-out, was made broader than
the others, so it could be plainly distinguished. This was
done at both ends of the field, and then the exact centre of
the field, on the eleventh five-yard line, was marked with
a large round spot to indicate the place of kick-off.</p>

<p>With this accomplished, the field was fully laid out, and
the setting of the goal-posts, the most difficult task of all,
followed. Sterndale selected four cedar posts which were
long and straight and obtained two cross-bars which satisfied
him in every particular. The posts were cut to a
length of twenty-three feet, which gave an allowance of
three feet to be sunk into the ground, and the cross-bars
were somewhat more than nineteen feet long, as the posts
were to be set exactly eighteen feet and six inches apart,
it being necessary for the cross-bars to over lap, so that
they might be securely spiked to the posts.</p>

<p>In setting the posts, the tape was stretched across the
end of the field and the middle of the line marked, which
was a distance of eighty feet from either side. This done,
with the middle mark as a starting point, nine feet and
three inches were measured off in opposite direction
along the line, the two points for the posts being thus determined.
Holes nearly three feet in depth were excavated
at these points and the posts erected in them, the
ground being packed solidly about them, causing them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
stand securely without braces, which are needless and
dangerous, as a player might trip over them or be forced
upon them and injured.</p>

<p>When Scott and Bentley reached the field they found
all the members of the newly-organized Rockspur Eleven
were present, besides a number of youthful spectators and
a few who were anxious to be classed as substitutes.</p>

<p>A little at one side from the others, Dick Sterndale, the
handsome, manly-looking captain of the team, was essaying
the drop-kick, coached by the boy Don Scott disliked,
Dolph Renwood. Renwood was rather slender, although
just now, in his padded football suit, he did not
look so, and he had sharp, blue eyes, which to the village
boys often seemed full of laughing scorn and contempt
even while he spoke to them in a most serious or friendly
manner. It was those eyes which caused the Rockspur
lads to distrust Dolph for all of his apparent sincerity and
interest in their sports and pleasures; and those eyes had
done not a little to arouse the resentment of quick-tempered
Don Scott, who bore half-hidden ridicule with less
grace than open contempt.</p>

<p>The players&#8217; bench used by the baseball team had been
moved aside to make room for the football field, but it
stood back by the rail in front of the bleachers, and Don
walked toward it, passing close to Sterndale and Renwood.
Having seated himself on the bench beside two
small boys, he was able to overhear Renwood&#8217;s instructions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
to the captain of the team, although he pretended to
be giving them no attention whatever.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are three ways to make a drop-kick,&#8221; Dolph was
explaining. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do it any old way, Sterndale. In
the first place, you must take hold of the ball right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; the big captain meekly asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may hold it with one hand, like this, with the
point toward the goal, and drop it that way, taking a
somewhat side-swinging kick; or you may hold it precisely
the same with both hands and drop it; or, finally,
you may hold it with both hands in this manner, pointing
it away from the goal. It must never be dropped flat or
directly upon the end. Now watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;coach&#8221; dropped the ball and kicked it handsomely,
sending it sailing through the air in a long, graceful
arc. It was pursued and captured by some small
boys, who had a scrimmage over it, out of which one
broke with it hugged under his arm and came running
back toward Dick and Dolph.</p>

<p>&#8220;In kicking the ball,&#8221; Renwood went on, &#8220;you must hit
it squarely with the toe the very instant that it rises off
the ground. Now let me see you try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sterndale took the ball from the panting youngster who
brought it up, held it with both hands as directed, and
dropped it. In kicking he was a trifle too quick, and the
result was anything but satisfactory.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; exclaimed Renwood, impatiently. &#8220;Don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
kick it after it hits the ground. Can&#8217;t you understand
that? Your toe must hit it just the instant it rises from
the ground. Try to fix that in your head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that Sterndale?&#8221; Don Scott asked himself, in amazement.
&#8220;Can it be that he&#8217;ll let anybody talk to him in that
tone of voice?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick was the acknowledged leader of the village boys
and their accepted commander in all things. As captain
of the baseball nine, he had seemed to know everything
worth knowing about the game, and he had been skillful
in imparting his knowledge to others and in handling his
men to the very best advantage. When the Rockspur lads
decided to organize a regular football team for the first
time, Sterndale was unanimously chosen captain, although
he confessed that he was almost unfamiliar with the
game.</p>

<p>The boys regarded it as a piece of good fortune when
Redwood offered to coach them, claiming to have been
a member of the Hyde Park A. A. C. and to have played
in a large number of football games in and around Boston;
but Scott and Bentley were not the only ones who
had been annoyed by the city lad&#8217;s supercilious ways and
condescending airs, although the others held their resentment
in check, feeling that they could not afford to antagonize
Dolph as long as he was instructing them in the
arts of the game they wished to learn.</p>

<p>Again Sterndale tried the drop-kick, and this time he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
was successful, sending the pigskin sailing through the
air in handsome style, so that Renwood declared:</p>

<p>&#8220;That was good. Try it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the ball was returned, the captain made a still
better kick, and again received an expression of approval
from the coach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Dolph, &#8220;all the members of the team seem
to be here, so I think we&#8217;d better get them together and
put in some practice on signals. They bungled things
terribly last night. I think you&#8217;ll find some of them are
no earthly good.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he said this, he turned and looked at Don Scott, who
felt on the instant that the words were meant for him, and
a pang of anger shot through his heart, causing his hands
to clench savagely and his jaws to harden.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have the best fellows in the village on the eleven,&#8221;
asserted Sterndale, loyally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good fellows do not always make good football players,&#8221;
said Dolph, knowingly. &#8220;But get them together,
and we&#8217;ll see if they can do any better than they did last
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Observing Don, Dick called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Scott. Where&#8217;s your suit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t need it,&#8221; returned the boy on the bench. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not going to practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; exclaimed Dick, walking over. &#8220;Oh, come,
that&#8217;s nonsense! You aren&#8217;t sick, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s different,&#8221; said the captain, quickly. &#8220;If
you&#8217;re sick, I don&#8217;t expect you to practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m sick,&#8221; he hoarsely declared. &#8220;I&#8217;m sick of
that fellow Renwood and his airs and insults. I&#8217;ve stood
them just as long as I can. I know he meant me when he
said some of the men on the team were no earthly good,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re mistaken,&#8221; cut in Dick, quickly. &#8220;Now,
wait a minute, Don. It was only a short time ago that
we thought of getting the team together for practice, and
he observed that you were not here, and that Bentley had
not arrived. He said we&#8217;d better wait, for, while we
might get along without Bent, we needed you in your
position as half-back. That was not all. He said that,
whatever changes were made on the team, he believed you
had been given the right position and should be kept
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Don found himself at a loss for words,
but he finally muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t mean it. It was just some of his sarcasm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure it was nothing of the sort. He was in
earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why did he make such talk to me last night?
And why did he look at me in such a way just now when
he said some fellows on the team were no earthly good?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t talk to you any plainer than he does to any
of the fellows. They say professional coaches sometimes
swear at the men they are training and are as bad as
slave-drivers. You must remember that he has been
coached by a professional on the team he played with in
Boston, and I suppose he considers that the proper way to
talk to men. Now, Don, old man, you know we can&#8217;t
get along without you on the eleven any more than we
could have made the record we did if you hadn&#8217;t been
on the nine. I know you&#8217;re loyal to Rockspur, and
you&#8217;re going to help us down those Highlanders. Don&#8217;t
mind the way Renwood gives his instructions, but just get
right into gear and show what you can do. I&#8217;m depending
on you, Scott.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick had a hand resting on Don&#8217;s shoulder while
speaking, and there was deep persuasion in his manner
and the inflection of his voice. It was this quality of
inducing others to do as he desired that had made Sterndale
a leader.</p>

<p>Don wavered a moment, the thought coming to him
once more that he must do his best to conquer his temper
and that this was another occasion for him to prove his
self-control, whereupon he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Sterndale; I&#8217;ll do it for you. But I can&#8217;t
stand everything from Renwood. I&#8217;ll get into a suit in a
hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he trotted off toward the dressing-room beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the grand-stand, while Dick, following him with his eyes,
muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound your surly temper! I&#8217;d like to tell you just
what I think of you, but it isn&#8217;t policy now, for we need
you on the team.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />


<small>DON LEAVES THE TEAM.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It did not take Don long to get into his football suit.
Danny Chatterton met him as he was coming from the
dressing-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you ch-ch-ch-changed your mind?&#8221; grinned the little
fellow, winking in a taunting manner. &#8220;Must have
cuc-cuc-cooled off sus-some after I left ye. Or was it
Bub-Bentley gug-got you to come along? He-he&#8217;ll make
a real good ch-ch-chum for you! Tell you what, I&#8217;d
rather be fuf-friendly with a stuck-up city chap, as you
cuc-cuc-call Renwood, than to only have a ch-chum like
Bub-Bentley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mind your own business, Chatterton!&#8221; harshly
advised Don. &#8220;I&#8217;m not making a chum of anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s a pup-pup-pup-pretty good reason for
that,&#8221; returned the aggravating little rascal, as he sidled
away. &#8220;If you had a ch-chum, you&#8217;d gug-get mad and
eat him inside of th-th-three days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scott bit his lip, assailed by a sudden conviction.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the reason I&#8217;ve never had a real chum,&#8221; he
thought. &#8220;It&#8217;s my temper. I have no one but myself to
blame, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was actually feeling humiliated and humble when
he joined the others, who were grouped about Renwood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
and Sterndale. Dolph and Dick were talking over the
code of signals and the simpler plays to be learned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Renwood, &#8220;when we become familiar
with the common and conventional plays, then we can
study up new formations and new moves in the game.
Until we&#8217;ve seen just what kind of material we have and
what sort of a team it forms as a whole, we cannot decide
upon our general style of playing. If the men prove to
be fast and light on their feet, we&#8217;ll see what we can do
in the way of running and surprise plays. If they are
not fast, but are dogged and heavy enough, we&#8217;ll see
what kind of a bucking team they&#8217;ll make. Or it is possible
we may find that we have a great kicking team.
But, no matter what general style of playing may be decided
upon, after getting into a game it may be found
expedient to change to another style in order to best assail
the weak points of the opposing team.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was plain, sensible talk, and the boys, with a
single exception, listened to it attentively. The exception
was Roger Ford, a deaf-mute, surely a peculiar fellow
to have upon a football team. Ford, however, was
a real athlete, a great runner and wrestler, and a fellow
of nerve, so that, at his own solicitation, he had been
given a place on the eleven, Sterndale having decided to
try him, for all of the fear that his deafness might prove
a serious detriment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Sterndale, your captain,&#8221; continued Dolph, &#8220;has
familiarized himself with the signals and certain plays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
that we are to try to-day. I presume the rest of you have
studied the signal code, so that you will know just what to
do on every occasion. If you wish to have the team succeed,
you must always do your level best to obey any
signal given. The fellow who is looking for individual
glory and an opportunity to show off will prove to be a
disadvantage and an encumbrance to the eleven.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke these words his eyes seemed to rest meaningly
on Leon Bentley, whose thin lips curled and who
turned away contemptuously.</p>

<p>When Renwood had delivered this little lecture, Sterndale
called for the men to line up, which, with some confusion,
they proceeded to do at the centre of the field.
The line-up was as follows:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td class="tdc" colspan="7">Sterndale,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdc" colspan="7">F. B.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Among those selected as possible substitutes was Thad
Boland, the laziest boy in town, who, in mockery of his
habitual slowness of movement, was generally called &#8220;Old
Lighting.&#8221; Thad was a big fellow, besides being wonderfully
strong, and, could he be aroused to action, it was
thought he would prove a perfectly irresistible thunder-bolt
in the line; but only something of a most remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
or alarming nature could arouse Thad to display his dormant
energies, although he enjoyed watching others indulge
in athletic games and contests, and was almost invariably
on hand when anything of the kind was going
on.</p>

<p>The best runners had been placed in the ends of the
line. During the baseball season which had just closed
John Smith had shown to his doubting companions that
he was a fellow of courage, nerve and coolness, and
Sterndale had insisted on giving him a position of prominence
on the eleven.</p>

<p>At John&#8217;s side was Rob Linton, his former enemy, now
his enemy no longer; while next came Jotham Sprout,
nicknamed &#8220;Bubble,&#8221; who was generally regarded as the
weakest man in the line, although it was hoped that his
blundering might turn to the advantage of the team, as
often had been the case in games of baseball.</p>

<p>Danny Chatterton had been placed at centre, where, on
the signal, he was to snap the ball back to Renwood, who
would pass it according to the pre-arranged plan.
Danny was rather quick in his movements, and Sterndale
had been convinced that he would be the best man for the
position.</p>

<p>On the left of Chatterton was the deaf-mute, Ford, who
had been given a position where the plays were nearly all
of a simple nature. Bentley, the cigarette-smoker, was left
tackle, and Dennis Murphy, a gritty and somewhat beligerant
Irish youth, stood on the extreme left end.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Taken all together, the material that composed the team
was as good as most small country towns could furnish.
It remained to be demonstrated what Sterndale and Renwood
could make of the material.</p>

<p>When every player was in position, the ball was placed
on the ground between Chatterton&#8217;s feet, and the crouching
men waited for the signal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to form and run forward with the ball ten
or fifteen feet, just the same as if you were in a game,&#8221;
said Dick, now taking command of them. &#8220;Ready!&#8221;</p>

<p>They crouched in anticipation, and then Dick quickly
called off several numbers, whereupon, with a skillful
movement, Chatterton snapped the ball into Renwood&#8217;s
hand and he passed it to Mayfair, who started like a flash,
hugging it under one arm and plunging after the men who
formed in front of him and rushed forward as interferers.</p>

<p>Jotham Sprout seemed rather bewildered, and, as a result,
he blocked Linton and fell over his own feet, while
the others surged across his body, giving him several
knocks and kicks, which caused him to sit up and howl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, what in time do you fellers take me for? Ev&#8217;ry
dinged one of you kicked me or stepped on me! I bet a
dollar my wish-bone is dislocated!&#8221; he moaned, rubbing
his fat stomach.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to keep awake if you&#8217;re going to play this
game,&#8221; sharply declared Renwood. &#8220;Better try that over
again, Captain Sterndale.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>&#8220;Line up again,&#8221; ordered Dick. &#8220;Now mind your p&#8217;s
and q&#8217;s. You&#8217;ll have to start quicker, Bubble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t start as quick as Chat,&#8221; confessed Jotham;
&#8220;but it&#8217;s going to take more to stop me when I get going.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the men were lined up again, the signal was repeated
and the play was carried out in a far more satisfactory
manner. Then the signal was changed so the ball
was passed to Scott for practically the same kind of a
play.</p>

<p>It is possible that Don was nervous, for he fumbled the
pass the very first time, and the ball quite escaped from
his clutch. This made him so angry that he sprang after
it and gave it a fierce kick. In a moment Sterndale was
at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do, old man,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;Any of us is
liable to make a fumble, so don&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mayfair didn&#8217;t!&#8221; panted Don, his face flushed and his
eyes flashing. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t my fault! I don&#8217;t propose to
be made a show of!&#8221; He gave Renwood a savage look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady!&#8221; warned Dick. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do! It was the same way yesterday. Put another
fellow in Renwood&#8217;s place and I&#8217;ll guarantee to get
the passes all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was enough to arouse Dolph, who promptly said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to blame any one else for your own fault,
Mr. Scott. I passed you the ball in exactly the same
manner that I passed it to Mayfair. He took the pass
cleanly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>&#8220;And by that you call me a fumbler, do you? All
right! I knew what would happen!&#8221; He took three
steps toward Renwood. &#8220;I knew you meant me when
you said there were some men on the team who were no
earthly good,&#8221; he went on, his anger blazing forth unrestrained.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t like me, because I won&#8217;t bow
down and let you walk on my neck. I&#8217;m not one of the
bowing kind, Mr. Renwood, and I&#8217;m just as good as you
are, if you have played football in Boston. You come
down here with your airs and expect to overawe us because
we live in the country, but you are nothing but a
stuck-up&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Sterndale grasped with crushing force the arm of the
angry and excited speaker, and he sternly said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop right where you are, Scott! You are making a
spectacle of yourself by letting your unreasonable anger
run away with your judgment. Renwood is our coach,
accepted by unanimous consent, and as such he has a
right to instruct and criticize us. We should feel under
obligations to him for his kindness, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His kindness!&#8221; snarled Don. &#8220;Bah! He has found
an opportunity to show off, and he&#8217;s making the most of
it. It is my opinion that we might do better without his
instructions and without him on the team. If we&#8217;ve got
to have him, let him go up into the line and take his
chance with the others. He chose his own position, where
he&#8217;ll always have something important to do, yet where
there is little danger of being hurt, for he never runs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
with the ball and he&#8217;s not in the front with the interference.
I can see through him, if the rest of you do
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>He would have said more, but Dick stopped him again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not another word of this, Scott!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
lost your head entirely, and you&#8217;d better&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll get out!&#8221; grated Scott. &#8220;Hands off me,
Sterndale! You are not my master! You can keep your
city cad on the team, and I&#8217;ll leave! That will settle it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tore himself from Sterndale and strode away. Renwood
was angry now and would have followed him, but
the boys stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him go,&#8221; said the captain. &#8220;No one can reason
with him when he gets that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to reason with him,&#8221; muttered Dolph,
who was pale round his mouth; &#8220;I want to hit him!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dick used his influence, and Don was permitted to
walk away, while Thad Boland was called in to make
up the eleven. Boland was given Smith&#8217;s position on the
end, Smith being brought back to the place made vacant
by Don.</p>

<p>Sitting alone on the bleachers, Don Scott saw the boys
line up again and continue practice without him. He
saw them try a number and variety of plays from signals,
and he heard Renwood give them instructions in forming
a wedge and in mass-play. He ground his white teeth together
as he watched them, and the hot fury within him
seemed burning and consuming his very heart. He noted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
that they seemed to get along quite well without him,
and it was plain that they were beginning to understand
some of the difficult strategy of the game, even if they
could not execute it rapidly. The formation for sending
a runner round the end was tried several times, and then
the &#8220;criss-cross,&#8221; or double-pass, was essayed until Smith
and Mayfair, working together, seemed to have obtained
some skill at it.</p>

<p>It was gall-and-wormwood for the fiery-tempered
youth, who, having put aside all desire to restrain and
control his anger, now entertained the most bitter and revengeful
thoughts. He was angry toward Bentley, too,
for not speaking out and siding with him in his outburst
against Renwood.</p>

<p>There was quite a gathering of spectators who watched
the practice, but Don noticed them very little, failing to
observe that among them were three girls who were
much interested.</p>

<p>At last the practice was over, Sterndale announcing
that they had done enough for one day. Then, as Renwood
was giving them some instructions about dieting
and getting into good condition, Don leaped down from
the bleachers and strode out upon the field. When the
group broke up, the coach found himself face to face with
the lad who had withdrawn from the team.</p>

<p>The rather handsome face of Don Scott was sullen and
scowling, and there seemed to be a gleam in his black
eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>&#8220;I have a few more words I want to say to you, Renwood!&#8221;
he said, his voice hoarse and unsteady.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I have something I want to say to you!&#8221; Dolph
flung back instantly. &#8220;A fellow with such a beastly
temper as you have isn&#8217;t fit to play football, and the team
will be better off without you.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a cry, Don sprang forward and drew back his
clenched fist, intending to strike Renwood full in the face;
but a pretty girl with gold-brown eyes stepped between
them, and he saw before him the sister of the fellow he
hated.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br />


<small>AN UNFORTUNATE COMPACT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Don&#8217;s hand dropped instantly and he fell back a step,
gasping and trembling, startled and abashed.</p>

<p>The slender left hand of the girl rested on the breast of
her brother, while her right was lifted with the open
palm toward his angry enemy, upon whom her eyes were
turned with an appealing look in their gold-flaked
depths.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; she said, shrinking a little before the clouded
face of the angry lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zadia!&#8221; exclaimed Dolph. &#8220;This is no place for
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>She would not let him put her aside. &#8220;No, no!&#8221; she
almost panted; &#8220;you shall not fight! Please, Mr. Scott,
don&#8217;t fight with Dolph! Promise me you will not&mdash;for
my sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Renwood flushed with shame, thinking the others might
fancy he was seeking protection from his enemy behind
his sister&#8217;s skirts; and he begged her to go away, but
she remained firm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure it is all a mistake, and there is no reason
why you should be enemies,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Anyhow, you
must not fight. You must promise me, Dolph, that you
will not fight with him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; muttered Renwood. &#8220;If he&#8217;s bound to
fight, I shall not run away. He&#8217;ll get all he wants.&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately the girl turned appealingly to Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must give me your promise,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Please do!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was hard to resist such an appeal from such a source,
and Don stood there biting his lip, silent and uncertain.
She stepped up to him boldly, and placed her hands on
both his arms, looking up into his flushed face in supplication.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please promise me!&#8221; she breathed.</p>

<p>He drew a long breath. &#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
promise; but don&#8217;t ask any more of me&mdash;don&#8217;t expect
anything more!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t deserve any thanks! I shall take care to
avoid your brother, as the easiest way to keep from breaking
my promise to you. I&mdash;I&#8217;m sorry anything happened&mdash;for
your sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice that had been harsh seemed to soften with
the final words, but he gave his head a toss as he turned
away; and then, without stopping or heeding anybody,
he hurried from the field.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose they&#8217;ll all say I&#8217;m to blame,&#8221; he muttered to
himself, as he walked swiftly past the academy and hastened
down the hill. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if they do! I
couldn&#8217;t stand it from that fellow, and that&#8217;s all there is
to it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>He had gone some distance before he noticed that he
was wearing the football suit and had left his own clothes
in the dressing-room beneath the grand-stand. When he
made this discovery, he paused a moment, tempted to go
back at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he finally said, shaking his head; &#8220;they&#8217;d be
there, and some of them would be changing their
clothes. I don&#8217;t want to see any of the fellows now&mdash;I
don&#8217;t want to talk it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he went on.</p>

<p>Had he returned, he might have arrived at the gate in
time to hear an interesting bit of conversation between
three girls. Zadia Renwood was talking with the two
companions who had accompanied her to the field, Dora
Deland and Agnes Mayfair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said Agnes, with genuine sympathy expressed
on her sweet face and in her dark eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry your brother should have trouble with any of the
boys, Zadia, and I&#8217;m sure Don Scott will be sorry when
he gets over being angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not very sure about that, myself,&#8221; Dora laughed,
with curling lips. &#8220;He has a frightful temper, which he
never tries to restrain, and I think he&#8217;s just perfectly horrid.
I can&#8217;t bear him. Of course he was entirely to
blame, and I think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he was not wholly to blame,&#8221; interrupted
Zadia, generously. &#8220;Even though Dolph is my brother,
I know he is not perfect.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s perfectly splendid,&#8221; smiled Dora; &#8220;and I
know Don Scott must have been to blame, for he always
is. So there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall tell Dolph that you were his champion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t&mdash;not for the world! But I don&#8217;t like Don
Scott; I never did. He scowls so, and he looks as if he&#8217;d
bite anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Zadia, with a little laugh, &#8220;if I were to
confess the truth, I&#8217;d tell you that I think him a handsome
fellow&mdash;really and truly I do! Ana he looks the handsomest
when he is angry. I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;d be afraid
of anything, and I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d become a natural leader if
he could master his temper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness, Zade!&#8221; cried Dora. &#8220;I really believe you
are struck on him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; protested Dolph&#8217;s sister, though she flushed
betrayingly. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t help liking him, for some
reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little did Don dream how the sister of the lad he so
disliked felt toward him, and he was convinced in his
heart that she must despise him, which, although he
would not confess it even to himself, made him all the
bitterer.</p>

<p>Concealed by a thick hedge near his home, he saw the
boys trooping down the street from the football field, chatting
and laughing. They seemed to have forgotten about
him, and he clenched his hands and ground his heel into
the ground as if crushing out a life beneath his foot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>&#8220;They&#8217;re a lot of soft things!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Not one
of them has a mind of his own or any real spirit. I
despise them all!&#8221;</p>

<p>The three girls seemed to have found companions suited
to their tastes, for they had paired off with three of
the boys. In advance were John Smith and Agnes Mayfair,
the tall lad looking rather awkward beside the
graceful, dark-eyed girl. Just behind them were Dolph
Renwood and Dora Deland, Dora seeming very well satisfied
with her conquest, if conquest it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;They make a good pair,&#8221; declared Don to himself,
with curling lips. &#8220;She&#8217;s called the prettiest girl in the
village, and it has spoiled her, for she thinks every fellow
who sees her is struck on her. She has an idea that the
village boys are not good enough for her, so she always
smiles on strangers. Just because Renwood comes from
Boston she has an idea that he&#8217;s a superior sort of person.
Bah! He is welcome to her, and she&#8217;s welcome to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Following Dolph and Dora were Dick Sterndale and
Dolph&#8217;s sister. The lips of the watching lad tightened
and his brows lowered.</p>

<p>&#8220;So she has taken up with Sterndale,&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;I expected she would, for he has a way of getting round
any girl; but she&#8217;s too good for him, even if she is Renwood&#8217;s
sister. If she&#8217;d ever heard him joke about his
mashes, as I have, she&#8217;d take care. She&#8217;d better keep
away from him if she values her good name.&#8221;</p>

<p>For all that Dora Deland was the belle of the village,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
in Don&#8217;s eyes she did not compare at all favorably with
the city girl, who carried herself with more grace and
whose clothes had a certain something about them that
bespoke better taste. In fact, there was that marked difference
between the two girls that always distinguishes
the city-bred from those reared in the country.</p>

<p>Dick&#8217;s hearty laugh rang out as his companion made
some observation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is where he lives,&#8221; said the captain of the
eleven, with a motion toward Don&#8217;s home.</p>

<p>The boy behind the hedge neared Dick&#8217;s words, and
then Zadia said something he did not hear, but Sterndale
laughed again in his hearty way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talking about me!&#8221; grated Don, his teeth clenched.
&#8220;She is laughing, too! I suppose she thinks I&#8217;m a common
country fool! What do I care for what she thinks!&#8221;</p>

<p>Still he watched them as they passed onward down the
tree-lined street, and his heart was hot in his bosom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she&#8217;ll not think so much of herself after she&#8217;s
been round with Sterndale a while,&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;for
just as sure as she lets him hang round her she&#8217;ll discover
people are talking. Everybody knows Sterndale,
and still it&#8217;s the strangest thing in the world that almost
any girl in the village would be glad to take up with him.
He has a way about him that makes them like him, no
mater what he does; while something about me makes
folks dislike me, no matter what I do. It&#8217;s my luck to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
be just as I am! I can&#8217;t help it! It&#8217;s no use for me to
try!&#8221;</p>

<p>His father drove up to the door, having just returned
from his afternoon calls; and Don took pains to keep
out of sight while Dr. Scott surrendered the horse and
carriage to Pat and entered the house, for he was in no
mood to meet his father just then.</p>

<p>When he was satisfied that all the boys had passed,
he went round to the back of the house and threw himself
on the ground beneath the sweet apple-tree, giving himself
up entirely to bitter thoughts.</p>

<p>He was mistaken, however, about all the boys having
passed, for he had not been reclining beneath the tree two
minutes before Leon Bentley appeared, slowly following
the others.</p>

<p>At sight of Bentley, Don sprang up, calling sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Bent, I want to see you. Come over here,
where we can talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bentley crossed the street and vaulted the fence. The
expression on his sallow face was anything but pleasant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I want to see you, too,&#8221; he said, apparently
paying no attention to Don&#8217;s scowl of anger. &#8220;This is
our chance to have a little talk where no one will hear
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know one thing,&#8221; said Don, &#8220;and that is if
you meant what you said to me here before we went up
to the field to practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I meant anything I said,&#8221; declared Leon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
flinging himself in a comfortable position on the ground.
&#8220;What are you driving at, old man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said you did not fancy Renwood&#8217;s style of lording
it over us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll stand by that, you can bet your life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You spoke about combining against him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it about time to do something of the
sort?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; flared Don, &#8220;when he gave me a call-down
on the field and we had our little trouble, you never
opened your head. You kept closed up, like a clam, and it
looked as if you sympathized with him. Why didn&#8217;t you
stand by me? Why didn&#8217;t you show your colors? What
ailed you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t fly off the handle,&#8221; grinned Leon, producing
a package of cigarettes, &#8220;You need something to
soothe your nerves. Have a cigarette?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! I don&#8217;t smoke them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know; but you&#8217;ll find them mighty soothing to the
nerves, and you need something of the sort. Try one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t like the smell of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will after you smoke a few. They&#8217;re great, old
man. Just try one, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too mad to smoke or do anything else but fight.
Take the things away! Why don&#8217;t you answer my question?&#8221;</p>

<p>Leon selected a cigarette and prepared it for lighting.
Don found it hard to restrain himself while the fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
was doing all this. When Bentley had lighted the cigarette,
he took a deep pull at it, inhaled the smoke, and let
it escape from his mouth in little puffs as he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What was your question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked you why you didn&#8217;t show your colors and
stand by me when I had my quarrel with Renwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t consider it policy just then, Don.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you saw I was all alone. Everybody seemed
against me. If you had put yourself openly on my side
just then I&#8217;d appreciated it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes it is best not to be too open in such affairs.
The matter with you is that you&#8217;re too open in everything.
If you hate a fellow, you let him know it right
off, so he&#8217;s prepared for any move you make against
him. Now, I don&#8217;t believe in that. If I hate a chap, I
just keep still till I get a good chance to soak him, and
then I can take him by surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leon said this with a foxy smile that was rather repulsive
to the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t fancy that way of doing things,&#8221; admitted
Don, promptly. &#8220;If I hate a fellow, I want him to know
it. It&#8217;s a satisfaction to have him know just what I think
of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it puts him on his guard against you. That&#8217;s not
my style. I&#8217;m just as sore on Renwood as you are, but
I felt that I might hit him harder if I kept still. I&#8217;m
onto him, and I know he&#8217;s down on me. He wants to
chuck me off the eleven, so I wasn&#8217;t going to play right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
into his hands by siding openly with you and giving him a
good excuse to turn Sterndale against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound Sterndale! I&#8217;m sick of him! He is letting
this city cad manage him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he is, but he&#8217;d get hot in a minute if anybody
told him so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think Renwood wants to get you off
the eleven?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s been throwing out hints. He&#8217;s said there
were some fellows on the team who were no earthly
good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard him say that!&#8221; grated Don; &#8220;and he meant me,
too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may have meant you for one, but I am the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I took pains to get near enough to overhear some
things he was saying to Sterndale after you left the field.
They didn&#8217;t see me, but I heard this sneak Renwood say
outright that he thought the eleven could be strengthened
by filling my place with somebody else. I felt like punching
his head then and there, but I just kept still and
didn&#8217;t let anybody know what I had heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have kept still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where you&#8217;re foolish. He said I smoke too
many cigarettes. Just as if that had anything to do with
my playing! What rot! And he even declared that I
lack nerve, so that I would weaken in a hard game.&#8221;</p>

<p>At another time Don Scott might have realized that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
had entertained similar convictions regarding Leon, but
just now he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;And you never did a thing? Why, I&#8217;d walked out to
him and showed him if I lacked nerve!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And got chucked off the team for your pains. But I&#8217;ll
show him! I&#8217;m going to stay on the team, and I&#8217;ll bet
ten dollars Mr. Dolph Renwood will get kicked off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don looked at his companion with new interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you propose to bring that about?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know just now, but I&#8217;ll do it. I have an
idea that Renwood doesn&#8217;t care a snap whether Rockspur
beats Highland or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, why is he coaching the team?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just to show off what he knows. I tell you, Don, if
you and I stand together, we can floor that fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m out of it; I&#8217;m no longer on the team.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, and I&#8217;ll report to you anything that may be of
interest. I&#8217;m going to lay some snares to trip Mr. Renwood,
and I may need your help. If I do, can I count on
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; was the doubtful answer. &#8220;It makes a
difference what you are going to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you know about that later,&#8221; said Bentley, rising.
&#8220;I want you to know that I&#8217;m your friend, and I sympathize
with you in this affair. We&#8217;ll stand by each other
to the end. Here is my hand on it, Scott. We&#8217;ll make
a compact against Dolph Renwood, and we&#8217;ll throw him
down, too. Shake!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>He held out his right hand, the first two fingers of
which were stained a sickly yellow.</p>

<p>Don hesitated, something within him revolting against
forming a compact with a fellow so unscrupulous and
crafty; but, for all that he would not confess as much
even to himself, he desired sympathy and friendship from
some one, and Leon seemed to be the only one to whom
he could turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; cried Bentley; &#8220;I&#8217;ll stick by you through thick
and thin, old man, and you will come out on top, too.
You&#8217;ll find me the best friend you ever had, Don.&#8221;</p>

<p>The best friend! Never had he known what it was to
have a real boy friend, and now he felt that it would be
churlish of him to refuse the proffered friendship of this
lad whose hand was extended to him in his time of trouble.
It was true there were many things about Leon that
he did not admire, but was there not about himself many
things that almost any other lad might dislike? In such
a time as this he must not be too particular.</p>

<p>Don took Bentley&#8217;s hand, but something like a shiver
ran over him when he felt Leon&#8217;s cold fingers rest in his
hot palm. On the instant he was almost sorry that he
had formed such a compact, but he fancied it was too
late to withdraw. The die was cast, and he could not
retreat then.</p>

<small>WORDS OF WISDOM.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>When Bentley had departed, Don entered the house, intending
to go directly to his own room and change his
clothes, after taking a bath. He had reached the foot of
the stairs when his father called to him from his office,
the door of which was standing open.</p>

<p>Don paused, a sudden thought assailing him and giving
him a shock. He remembered now that his father had
returned shortly before the appearance of Leon and, without
doubt, he had been in his office at the time the two
boys were forming their compact beneath the apple-tree.
If so, he had overheard all that passed between them, as,
earlier in the day, he overheard his son&#8217;s talk with Danny
Chatterton, in which case he must be aware that Don had
given way to a burst of anger, for all of the promise to
try to restrain and govern his temper.</p>

<p>But that was not all. Despite himself, Don could not
help feeling that there was something censurable, almost
reprehensible, in his compact with Leon Bentley, formed
for the purpose of working injury to a lad whom they
hated. For this reason, his face flushed and he was
seized by a sudden dread of his father&#8217;s kindly yet searching
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don!&#8221; again called that voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, father,&#8221; he answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>&#8220;Come here a minute. I wish to speak with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy felt like running away, but he summoned his
courage and entered the room which served Dr. Scott as
an office.</p>

<p>The gentleman was sitting at his desk close by the window,
which was screened and curtained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said the doctor, motioning toward a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stand, if you please, father,&#8221; said Don. &#8220;I am in
my football suit, which I wish to change as soon as possible,
for I&#8217;m rather sweaty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you changed your mind about not playing on the
eleven? I&#8217;m glad you did so, for I like to see my son
interested in the honest and manly sports which interest
other boys of the village.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Football is a rather vigorous game, to say the least,&#8221;
smiled Dr. Scott, gently. &#8220;Some say it is rough and brutal,
but, if played strictly according to the present rules, it
is hardly brutal, and it develops in the player alertness,
decision, resolution and courage, qualities of paramount
value to every man who would rise in the world above
the common level of humanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>But for the dread of what he anticipated was to follow,
Don himself might have smiled, thinking as he did how
few fathers regarded thus favorably the game in question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have taken pains to investigate this matter,&#8221; the
doctor went on, &#8220;for I have noted the outcry against football
coming from various quarters, and I wished to determine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
if it is a game suitable for my son. Baseball
meets my hearty approval, although a clean, healthy sport
like that may be carried to excess, and even amateur
players should be properly trained and hardened so that
no evil effects may follow the exertions of the game,
which call for sharp runs, straining, jumping, and so
forth. In baseball it occasionally happens that a player is
severely or seriously injured, but the timid lad who avoids
the game because of this is pretty sure to lack courage to
fight the battle of life to a successful consummation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The waiting lad wondered that his father should say all
this, for it had been understood between them that baseball
was a game in which Don might indulge to his full
inclination, as long as he did not permit it to interfere
with his studies or other duties.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having taken pains to investigate the records in
regard to football,&#8221; continued the doctor, &#8220;I have found
that there are a large number of accidents in connection
with the game, but I have also found that these accidents
and injuries generally fall to the lot of the untrained and
unprepared. A race horse cannot be kept in running condition
unless he receives proper grooming, diet and exercise.
Every day it must be &#8216;let out&#8217; for speed, but judgment
must be used to work it up to a proper condition for
the great test of the race, when every nerve must be
strained in order to win. Almost any horse could be
ruined by putting it into a single race without proper
training. Yet some young men are foolish enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
fancy they can go into a game of football without preparation
and exert themselves with impunity to their very
utmost, running, kicking, pushing and tackling. Every
boy or man who does such a thing takes his life in his
hands. If he is not killed, he stands a good chance to be
injured for life. And it is these unprepared and foolish
persons who receive the most of the injuries. Some lads
should never play football, being physically unfitted for
such a game; but, with proper training and preparation
in all cases, I believe accidents and injuries may be
diminished one-half, at least.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my son, I am telling you this because I have
observed that you are inclined to be careless. You are
impulsive, and you would not hesitate to take part in a
match game of football utterly without proper training
and preparation. Not only that, but, having taken part
in practice that exerts you and covers your body with
perspiration, you are careless of your health. As soon as
possible after leaving the field, you should have removed
your clothes, which were damp with perspiration, taken a
bath and a rub-down and donned dry clothes. Instead
of that, you lay down on the ground out there beneath
that apple-tree, where you spent considerable time talking
to another boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father,&#8221; said Don, seeking an excuse to get away,
&#8220;you are keeping me from my bath now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are to take cold this time, the injury is done
already. I chose to talk to you right now, while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
matter was on my mind. Had I put it off, I might have
forgotten all about it. With proper care, Don, there is
little danger that you will take cold, even though you
exercise, practice and play football in any and all kinds of
weather. It is neglect after such efforts that works the
injury. In the future I wish you to be careful, just as
I wish you to go ahead and take an active interest in
making the Rockspur Eleven a strong country team. If
possible, I shall take pains to witness one or two of the
games, and I hope to see you doing your level best on the
team.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was on Don&#8217;s lips to tell his father that he was no
longer a member of the Rockspur Eleven, but, seeing the
doctor scrutinizing him closely and realizing that he must
make an explanation in regard to his withdrawal from
the team, which meant a full confession concerning his
loss of temper on the field, he hesitated and was silent.</p>

<p>Apparently, Dr. Scott had paused to give his son a
chance to speak if he wished, and there was something
like a look of disappointment on his fine face when Don
failed to say anything. At least, Don fancied that his
father looked disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;In order to become a successful football player, Don,&#8221;
said the doctor, breaking his silence when he saw the boy
did not intend to speak, &#8220;you must receive instructions
from those who know more about the game than you do,
and you must take pains to follow the instructions as fully
and faithfully as possible. A good soldier obeys his commander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
implicitly, without question or rebellion. A good
football player should be as obedient as a good soldier.
On the field, in practice and in play, you must let yourself
be governed by your superiors, even though at times you
find it necessity to hold yourself hard to keep from rebelling
or from doing things the way you, yourself, fancy
they should be done. No successful organization ever
existed that did not have a commander who was obeyed,
and the best commanders are those who have themselves
learned well the lesson of exact and faithful obedience.
If you ever expect or hope to rule others, my son, first
learn the lesson of obedience and learn to rule your own
disposition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don&#8217;s face was flushed now, for, although his father had
not referred to it directly, he felt that the open window
had betrayed the exact condition of affairs. The doctor
had chosen this indirect method of reproving his son for
permitting himself to be ruled by his anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all I have to say,&#8221; concluded Dr. Scott, &#8220;with
the exception of one thing: Shun evil companions. Better
no friends than the friendship of the bad and vicious.
Any boy who seeks revenge on another in a secret, underhand
manner is vicious, and his companionship will prove
degrading. Now get your bath, my boy, and change your
clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don was relieved to escape from his father&#8217;s presence,
for his cheeks were burning and his ears tingling.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br />


<small>A BATTLE IN A HEART.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hang it!&#8221; muttered Don, when he was alone in his
room; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want him to know. I&#8217;d have given anything
rather than have him know, and I&#8217;m sure he does
know, from what he said at the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bath-room was just outside his door, and he had
started the water running into the porcelain tub. In a
savage manner he began to strip off his football suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t see me playing on the Rockspur Eleven this
year,&#8221; he said, harshly. &#8220;I&#8217;m done with that crowd, the
whole of them!&#8221;</p>

<p>This caused him to think of Leon Bentley and his compact
with the fellow, and he realized that he was not
&#8220;done&#8221; with one member of the village eleven, at least.</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather father would have known about anything
else!&#8221; he murmured, his cheeks burning again. &#8220;I was a
fool to have anything to do with Bentley, and I&#8217;m beginning
to think I&#8217;d better withdraw from that compact, even
though it is backing out of an agreement. I hate Renwood,
but I don&#8217;t care about getting revenge on him in a
sneaking way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stripped off his damp underclothes and hung them
up to dry, after which he took a towel from a drawer in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the dressing-case and started for the bath-room, which he
was able to reach with almost a single step from his door.</p>

<p>The water in the tub was cool, almost cold, but he
plunged in without hesitation. The bath was followed by
an energetic rub-down with the rough towel, bringing a
glow to his entire body and giving him a feeling of
warmth, freshness and vigor. A mirror showed him a
handsomely-formed lad, like the figure of a youthful athlete
cut from pink marble.</p>

<p>Don returned to his room and dressed, thinking all the
while of his father&#8217;s words, which had impressed him
deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right to talk about obeying one&#8217;s commander,&#8221;
he said to himself, &#8220;but Renwood is not my commander.
Sterndale is manager and captain of the eleven. Now, if
it had been Sterndale&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, assailed by the thought that, under aggravating
circumstances of a similar nature, he might have
rebelled against Sterndale. Besides that, in a certain
sense, Renwood was his superior on the eleven, having
been accepted as the regular coach of the team.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course I&#8217;m all to blame!&#8221; he half snarled, as he
plunged into a fresh shirt. &#8220;Everybody will say so, even
my own father.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he softened again, realizing that, even though his
father must have come to understand the truth from the
conversation overheard outside his window, he had not
uttered a single word of open reproach.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;At least,&#8221; whispered the boy, softly, &#8220;he is my friend,
and I must try hard to please him. He has done enough
for me, so that I must do what I can for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>How few boys feel this way toward their fathers! The
fact that Don Scott could think such a thing at such a
time proved his heart was right, for all of his headstrong
disposition and violent temper.</p>

<p>In his soul Don knew he had been hasty in his actions,
though he tried to convince himself that he had done
nothing wrong. However, esteeming his father as he did,
he felt that it was his duty to make a sacrifice, even
though it might be necessary to humble himself to a certain
extent in order to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to him and tell him everything,&#8221; he decided.
&#8220;He will think better of me if I do, for it is almost certain
that he heard enough of my talk with Bentley to let him
know what has happened. As I kept silent when he gave
me an opportunity to tell him, he&#8217;ll think I did not attempt
to keep my promise to try to control my temper, and
I&#8217;ll seem like a sneak in seeking to hide the truth from
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Any healthy-minded boy dreads being thought a
&#8220;sneak,&#8221; and regards such an appellation as almost the
greatest possible slur that can be cast upon him; so it was
not strange that, imagining as he did, that his father
might think such a thing of him, Don should wish to set
himself right.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go straight to him as soon as I&#8217;m dressed,&#8221; he resolved,
hastily getting into his clothes.</p>

<p>He stood before the glass and carefully knotted a dark-red
four-in-hand necktie, which was his favorite, having
been presented to him by his aunt, sister to his father,
who was housekeeper in the Scott home, and who had
tried to be a mother to the doctor&#8217;s son since the death of
Mrs. Scott, which took place when Don was a little more
than a year old.</p>

<p>Having knotted the tie with care and thrust a small
gold pin through the knot, he buttoned on his cuffs,
donned his coat and vest, and was ready to go downstairs.</p>

<p>At the door he paused, overcome for the moment by
the thought of facing his father and making the confession,
and there he stood some little time, forming in his
mind the speech he would make. It required considerable
courage on his part to keep from backing out and giving
up his resolution then and there, but he would not permit
himself to yield to such weakness; and so, with renewed
determination, he left his room and lightly descended the
carpeted stairs.</p>

<p>At the door of his father&#8217;s office he paused, for the doctor
was standing in the waning light that came from the
curtained window, gazing earnestly upon a gold-framed
miniature which he held in his hand. The boy could not
see his father&#8217;s face, but, having seen that miniature before,
he knew it was the picture of his dead mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>As Don halted in irresolution, a sigh and a half-smothered
sob came from his father, who raised the miniature
to his lips, murmuring:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary, Mary, you forgave me at last, but I&#8217;ve never
forgiven myself! But for my act of anger I might have
you with me now. Heaven grant his temper may bring
no such sorrow to our son!&#8221;</p>

<p>As quietly as possible, Don stole away and sought his
aunt, a rather stout, pleasant-faced woman, who was getting
supper on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness, Don!&#8221; she exclaimed pretending to be
alarmed. &#8220;You came in so still that you frightened me.
It&#8217;s not your way to creep about like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to frighten you, Aunt Ella,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
came to tell you that I am going out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now? Why, it&#8217;s just supper time, and I&#8217;ll have
everything ready in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anything; I couldn&#8217;t eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Land! land! What in the world is the matter with
you? You&#8217;re a healthy, growing boy, and you generally
have an appetite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any to-night, aunt. I couldn&#8217;t eat anything;
it would choke me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something is the matter! Don, you&#8217;re sick!&#8221; She was
alarmed in a moment. &#8220;I&#8217;ll call your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t aunt,&#8221; interposed Don, stopping her. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
sick&mdash;truly I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what ails ye?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>&#8220;Nothing, only&mdash;I&#8217;ve lost my appetite. Perhaps if I go
for a long walk, the exercise may give me an appetite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you had any exercise to-day? I saw the boys
going to the ball ground to play football. Didn&#8217;t you
go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And still you say you haven&#8217;t any appetite! Now, I
know there&#8217;s something the matter with you. Won&#8217;t you
tell your old aunt all about it, Don? You know I&#8217;m interested,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing&mdash;noting at all!&#8221; declared the boy, somewhat
impatiently. &#8220;I just don&#8217;t want any supper, that&#8217;s
all, and I want you to tell father I&#8217;ve gone out for a walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you ought to tell him yourself before
you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he&#8217;s busy now. I&#8217;ve just come from his office,
but I didn&#8217;t go in when I saw he was busy. You tell him,
aunt. Perhaps I&#8217;ll have an appetite when I come back.
Now, that&#8217;s a good aunt! Don&#8217;t get any queer notions
into your head, for I&#8217;m all right, only I don&#8217;t feel like
eating.&#8221;</p>

<p>He suddenly caught her in his arms and kissed her.
Then he was gone, leaving her standing there with
clasped hands. She listened till the sound of a closing
door told her he had left the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just like his father!&#8221; she murmured, softly. &#8220;Just as
his father used to be, but Lyman has changed greatly
since he lost Mary. Will he never forget?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>Then she continued the preparations for supper.</p>

<p>Don walked swiftly away from the house, fearing his
aunt might immediately tell his father, who would call
him back. On reaching the sidewalk, he paused for a
moment, glancing down the street toward the little square
in the heart of the village. He saw two youths cross
the square, passing the little fountain. They were Sterndale
and Renwood, and he turned his back toward the
square, hurrying up the hill.</p>

<p>He was grasped by a feverish desire to be all alone and
walk, walk, walk; so he kept on up Academy Hill, passing
the white building beneath the trees. When he
reached the fenced-about football field, he turned to the
right and took the road that led toward Wolf&#8217;s Head
Point.</p>

<p>He took off his hat to let the cool wind from the open
sea fan his hot forehead as he strode along. All the while
his thoughts were busy, and within his soul a battle was
taking place.</p>

<p>The point was reached. He passed the home of the
light-keeper, but, instead of approaching the light-house,
which towered in a white column on the extremity of the
point, he turned to the left and mounted to the ragged top
of a mass of ledges, where he found a seat, with the rising
tide murmuring and swirling amid the crevices and crannies
below him.</p>

<p>Sunset&#8217;s after-glow glinted the waves, but afar on the
bosom of the sea lay a purple haze that seemed to blend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
with sea and sky and connect both; and out of the purple
sea-mist loomed a white-winged vessel, headed for Rockspur
Harbor, which it could not reach before darkness
fell. Away toward the ledges by the harbor mouth some
gulls skimmed the waves, uttering harsh and melancholy
cries. Overhead a few vapory clouds were tinted with
pink and edged with burnished gold.</p>

<p>Don gave little heed to his surroundings as he sat there
in the ledge, staring down at the restless water that ran
green and foamy over the broken rocks, but the expression
on his mobile face indicated that the battle within
him was waxing fiercer.</p>

<p>He had long known that the death of his mother had
cast a great shadow on his father&#8217;s life, but never till this
day had he suspected that Dr. Scott held himself in any
respect responsible for the loss of his wife.</p>

<p>Don had discovered that his mother&#8217;s miniature, painted
on ivory, was constantly carried near his father&#8217;s heart.
More than once he had, without being observed, seen his
father gazing sadly and lovingly at that picture; but on
this last occasion the doctor&#8217;s murmured words, unintended
for his ears, had given him an inkling of the truth
of the great sorrow that had fallen upon his father.</p>

<p>Some act of the doctor, done in a moment of anger, had,
as he firmly believed, hastened or brought about the death
of his wife. For this angry deed he had never forgiven
himself, and now he was filled with foreboding and distress
because he saw his son had inherited his ungovernable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
temper and because he feared the end to which it
might lead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no right to cause my father so much pain,&#8221;
thought Don, self-reproachfully. &#8220;He&#8217;s always been kind
to me. I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know about my mother, for he never
told me. I don&#8217;t suppose he could bring himself to talk
about it. I must do something to relieve him&mdash;something
to assure him that I am trying to govern my temper and
master myself. But, oh, it is hard to humble myself before
that fellow Renwood! How can I do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The struggle within him continued while the light died
slowly in the western sky, the pink and gold left the
clouds dull and lead-colored, and the blue haze deepened
into darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; he finally exclaimed, rising to his feet.
&#8220;For father&#8217;s sake, I&#8217;ll go to Sterndale and say I&#8217;m sorry.
I&#8217;ll even ask Renwood&#8217;s pardon, if I must; but that will
be worse than swallowing red-hot iron!&#8221;</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen, but from the light-house on the
point a light shone forth to guide the belated vessel
lost to view on the bosom of the night-encompassed
sea.</p>

<p>In the heart of the boy another light glimmered weakly,
seeking to burst into a bright flame that should guide in
the right course his passion-shrouded soul.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br />


<small>IN THE CLUB-ROOM.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Nearly all the members of the newly-formed Rockspur
Athletic Club, of which Dick Sterndale was the president
and ruling spirit, had gathered in their recently-rented
rooms in the loft of a two-story-and-a-half wooden building
next to the post-office.</p>

<p>The upper floor of the building had been partitioned off
into two rooms for some purpose, one being a small and
the other a large room. The walls were ceiled up with
plain boards, and the rafters of the sloping roof remained
unhidden from view; but to the village boys it seemed an
admirable place to meet their requirements for a gymnasium
and club-room, having been obtained for them
through the energies of Sterndale, who had organized the
club and raised the needed funds.</p>

<p>It had long been Sterndale&#8217;s ambition to form in Rockspur
an amateur athletic club and build a club-house that
should be appointed to meet the requirements of such an
organization. It had seemed like a wild and foolish
dream, but still he clung to it; and now, for the first time,
he was revealing his desire in this line to his companions,
who listened attentively and with growing enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;By jingoes! that&#8217;s great!&#8221; cried Jotham Sprout, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
Dick had finished. &#8220;I&#8217;d never thought of that myself.
Fellers, let&#8217;s go ahead and build that club-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s!&#8221; grunted Thad Boland, who was lolling in
a lazy position on a wooden bench against the partition.
&#8220;It won&#8217;t cost more than two or three thousand dollars,
and we&#8217;re all millionaires, so that&#8217;ll be a mere nothing to
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think about what it would cost,&#8221; admitted Bubble,
with a crestfallen air. &#8220;But of course it wouldn&#8217;t be
as much as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a club-house as Sterndale has been talking about
would cost twenty-five hundred dollars, at least,&#8221; put in
Rob Linton. &#8220;It&#8217;s no use to think of such a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bub-bub-bub-but it&#8217;s a pup-pup-pup-perfectly lovely
dud-dud-dud-dream!&#8221; sighed Danny Chatterton, opening
his eyes and slowly looking around. &#8220;I just hu-hate to
wake up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to sleep again,&#8221; advised Walter Mayfair. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
never be missed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a splendid plan,&#8221; came, with enthusiasm, from
Dolph Renwood, who was sitting on a rough table, the
edge of which he was notching with his jack-knife. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a pity it can&#8217;t be carried out, and I&#8217;m not so sure but it
can be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;HOW?&#8221; shouted all the others, as one person.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could get the leading citizens of the town interested,
they might contribute to a fund to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Contribute to your Aunt Hannah!&#8221; grunted Thad Boland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
derisively. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you know much about
the leading citizens of this town, Mr. Renwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must have some rich men who are public-spirited
and can afford to help along such a worthy move?
Now, there is Mr. Tuttle, for instance. They say he has
dead loads of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Tut-Tut-Tuttle!&#8221; exploded Chatterton, contemptuously.
&#8220;Why, he lul-lul-lul-let his own bub-bub-brother
die on the pup-pup-poor-farm! He&#8217;s mum-mean enough
to sus-skin a louse for its hide and taller!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there is Eben Snood,&#8221; ventured Dolph. &#8220;He
pretends to take great interest in the welfare and advancement
of the town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Snood is worse than Tuttle,&#8221; asserted Rob Linton.
&#8220;Before he will let go of a cent he&#8217;ll squeeze it so hard
that it looks as if it had been run over by a railroad
train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think,&#8221; said Sterndale, &#8220;that we can expect any
assistance from the people of the village till we show that
we are in earnest by starting the fund ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey?&#8221; gasped Old Lightning. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got seven
cents and a fish-hook that I&#8217;ll contribute, if you&#8217;re going
to take up a collection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll not begin by taking up a collection,&#8221; Dick declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then hu-how can we begin?&#8221; asked Danny, earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;By saving the money we take at the gate when we
play football, baseball, or anything of that sort; by getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
up athletic contests that will call out paying crowds
to witness the sport; and by holding a series of entertainments
in the Town Hall this winter. In that way we
might be able to obtain the beginning of a fund that
would in time become large enough for us to accomplish
our purpose and build a club-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too long to wait, b&#8217;ys,&#8221; murmured Dennis Murphy.
&#8220;Av we raised the money thot way, we moight get it in
toime to build an ould men&#8217;s home fer some av us, an&#8217;
we&#8217;d be lucky at thot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; nodded Leon Bentley. &#8220;I believe in
getting some benefit from the money as we receive it, and
I&#8217;m in for using it up. I want to spend my share.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t heard from you, Smith,&#8221; said Sterndale,
addressing a grave-looking lad, who had been listening
without speaking. &#8220;What do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is a great scheme, if it can be carried out,&#8221;
answered John Smith. &#8220;I believe we should talk this over
and investigate it fully. It does seem rather visionary
now, but it may be practical.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you I don&#8217;t take any stock in it!&#8221; exclaimed Bentley,
rather pettishly. &#8220;We can&#8217;t hold an organization together
long enough to carry out the scheme. Why, just
see how this Don Scott affair has broken us up already.
We don&#8217;t know where to get a good man to fill Scott&#8217;s
place. Something else may come up later, and the eleven
and the club may disband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dud-don&#8217;t be forever cuc-cuc-croaking, Bent!&#8221; exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
Chatterton. &#8220;You&#8217;re always expecting something
bub-bad to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ford, the deaf-mute, was the only member of the party
who had not expressed an opinion of some sort. He sat
there among them, looking on, his eyes bright and keen,
apparently enjoying their society, if not their conversation.</p>

<p>Renwood flipped his jack-knife, causing it to strike,
point first and stand up in the soft wood table.</p>

<p>&#8220;If other men of the place would take an interest,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I believe I could interest my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By George! that&#8217;s a handsome knife, old man!&#8221; Bentley
observed, reaching over and taking it. &#8220;Pearl-handled
and four-bladed. Got your initials on the handle, too. I&#8217;d
like to have a knife like that. How much did it cost?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Father gave it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my old man wouldn&#8217;t think of giving me a knife
like that. He thinks any kind of an old toad-sticker is
good enough for a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bentley seemed to regard the handsome knife with
longing eyes, then he placed it on the table again beside
Dolph.</p>

<p>&#8220;This Scott affair is unfortunate, to say the least,&#8221; admitted
Sterndale; &#8220;but I have no idea that it will cause
the breaking up of the eleven. He is only one man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Renwood seems to think there are other men on
the team who had better get off, or who will be fired off,&#8221;
said Bentley.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>&#8220;How do you know I think so?&#8221; asked Dolph, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, haven&#8217;t you said as much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I may have said that some were not much good,
but I said nothing about their getting off or being fired
off. If anybody is fired, it will be his own fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it was nobody&#8217;s fault but Scott&#8217;s that he got
off the team?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely not. He&#8217;s a hot-headed fellow, and he needs
to be kept in his place. He&#8217;s had his own way all his life,
and he&#8217;s spoiled. He insulted me, the coach of the team,
on the field, and I should have demanded an apology if he
had remained on the eleven. He made it plain that it
would be impossible for him and me to pull together on
the same team, and I&#8217;m sure we shall get along just as
well without him.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a quick step outside the door, and Don Scott
himself came into the room. The lowering expression on
his dark face told that he had overheard Renwood&#8217;s words,
and his flashing eyes indicated that again he was aroused.
Fixing his eyes on Dolph, he walked straight up to the
table on which the city lad was seated.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Renwood,&#8221; he said, in a voice that
quivered from the tensity of his feelings, &#8220;you and I could
never pull together on the same team. That is settled at
last for all time, and I now give notice that I will withdraw
from both the eleven and this club. Just as long as
you are a member of either I shall stay out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don Scott had come there to say something entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
different, but again that day his passions were aroused, as
he had overheard Dolph&#8217;s final speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume you are at liberty to withdraw if you like,&#8221;
said Renwood.</p>

<p>Don turned to the captain of the eleven.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may choose between us, Sterndale!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I
belong in Rockspur, I am one of the village fellows, and
this chap is an outsider. I don&#8217;t believe he really cares a
rap whether Rockspur has a winning team or not. He
simply likes to show off what he knows, or what he pretends
to know. If he took a notion, I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;d throw a
game to Highland in a minute, and I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Renwood sprang down from the table and seemed on
the point of striking the insulting speaker; but, with a curl
of his scornful lips, Don folded his arms, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike! You are safe, for you know I can&#8217;t hit you
back, having promised your sister that I would not fight
with you. Strike!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dolph&#8217;s fist fell at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take back your promise!&#8221; he panted. &#8220;I demand it!
You have insulted me, and you must give me satisfaction!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a show of contempt, Don half-turned his back on
the quivering city youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had my say,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;You may take your
time to think it over, Sterndale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he walked out of the room, and they heard him
descend the stairs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>For some moments all in the room seemed to remain
motionless and breathless. Dennis Murphy broke the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;yer moind now, thot b&#8217;y is a hot birrud!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t hit him!&#8221; grated Dolph, still shaking. &#8220;He
took refuge behind his promise to my sister. But he&#8217;ll
have to face me! I&#8217;ll force him to do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then came comments and remarks from all quarters,
and it was some time after Scott&#8217;s departure before the
boys cooled down. As he resumed his position on the
table, Renwood discovered that his knife was missing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s become of my knife?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It was here
on the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you put it into your pocket?&#8221; asked Bentley.</p>

<p>Dolph shook his head. &#8220;No; I left it lying on the table.
Scott came in just a moment after you put it back there.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, he felt through his pockets, but did not find
it. Then the boys searched for the knife, looking under
the table and into all sorts of corners. Again Renwood
searched his pockets, turning them wrongside out one by
one, but with no better success than before.</p>

<p>The knife was not found.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br />


<small>A STRUGGLE IN THE DARK.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Straight from Wolf&#8217;s Head Point to the club-rooms
Don Scott had come, with a determination to have a talk
with Sterndale, express his regret at what had happened
that day on the football field and apologize to Renwood, if
absolutely necessary. This he was resolved to do for his
father&#8217;s sake, not wishing to cause the doctor further
worry and distress on his account.</p>

<p>By chance he had arrived at the club-room just in time
to hear Renwood denounce him as hot-headed and declare
they could not both get along on the eleven.</p>

<p>Don left the place in no enviable frame of mind, at
once turning his face toward home.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use for me to try!&#8221; he muttered, furiously. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t have anything to do with that fellow, even for
father&#8217;s sake. I did think I would, though it was a
bitter pill to swallow, but I give it up now. To-morrow
I&#8217;ll tell father everything, and I don&#8217;t see how he can
blame me very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he reached home, he found his aunt had something
on the table for him to eat, and she urged him to
sit down. The doctor had been called out on a critical
case, not a little to Don&#8217;s relief, for the boy feared his
father might question him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Don did not wish to eat anything even then, but his
aunt was persistent, and he sat down to please her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can be the matter with you, Don?&#8221; the good
woman asked, watching him closely. &#8220;You&#8217;re awful pale,
and your hand shakes. I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re going to be
sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>He forced a laugh, difficult though it was to do so, and
did his best to reassure her, though he could not fully allay
her anxiety. It was with no small difficulty that he compelled
himself to eat anything, for anger had robbed him
entirely of his appetite.</p>

<p>As soon as he could get away, he hurried up to his
room, where he paced the floor for a time, thinking unpleasant
thoughts and muttering to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said I was done with the whole of them,&#8221; he grated,
&#8220;and now I&#8217;ll stick by it. Of course I know Sterndale
will stand by Renwood. Oh, they&#8217;re a fine set!&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the closet door and dragged out his football
suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;This belongs to the club,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for it was paid for
out of the general funds. I won&#8217;t keep it another hour.
My clothes are in the dressing-room under the grand-stand,
but I have a key to the lock. I&#8217;ll take this old suit
back and get my own clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a bundle of the football suit, and, with it under
his arm, slipped downstairs and out of the house.</p>

<p>Hurrying up the street, he climbed Academy Hill once
more that day. The night was quite dark, for the moon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
had not yet risen. It was rather cool, too; but the boy
minded this not, for his blood was running swiftly in his
body.</p>

<p>Reaching the ball ground, he opened the gate and entered.
With noiseless steps, he advanced toward the
grand-stand. As he approached it, he suddenly stopped,
fancying he heard a strange sound. After a moment,
however, he advanced to the door of the dressing-room.</p>

<p>To his surprise, the door was standing wide open. He
paused again, wondering at this, for it was a rule to keep
the door locked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A piece of carelessness!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Somebody
ought to be shot for it! Why, there&#8217;s plenty of stuff here
that might be stolen. Somebody might have taken my
clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was startled by the thought. Perhaps somebody
had been there and carried away his clothes, leaving the
door standing open. With a little cry of dismay, he
sprang into the dressing-room, intending to light a match
and look about.</p>

<p>In the darkness he collided violently against a human
form, which caused him to reel backward.</p>

<p>Some one was in the dressing-room!</p>

<p>Don heard a smothered exclamation, and then the unknown
attempted to dart past him and escape by the open
door.</p>

<p>Quick as thought, Don dropped the football suit and
clutched at the unseen figure, crying:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>&#8220;Hold on! What are you doing in here?&#8221;</p>

<p>He grasped the other, who made a desperate effort to
jerk away, but Don held fast, and directly a fearful struggle
took place in the darkness of the dressing-room.</p>

<p>Finding that the sole object of the unknown seemed to
be to break away and escape, Don was convinced that the
fellow had been doing something crooked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let go!&#8221; was panted, in a hoarse tone of voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess not!&#8221; returned Don. &#8220;Just keep still, will
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the other would not keep still, and Don felt for his
throat, grating:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll have to choke you till you do keep still!&#8221;</p>

<p>But he could not secure the hold he desired, for his
antagonist fought him off. At last, getting a grasp about
the fellow&#8217;s body, Don tripped and threw him heavily,
coming down upon him with crushing violence.</p>

<p>Apparently the fall had stunned the unknown for the
moment, at least, as he lay quite still. Noting this, Don
rose to his knees and felt in his pockets for a match, which
he intended to light.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon see who you are, my fine fellow,&#8221; he
thought, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll learn what sort of a game you were
playing all by your lonesome.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was breathing heavily from his exertions and his
hands shook somewhat, for the encounter in the dark
with a mysterious antagonist had been decidedly trying to
his nerves.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>To his great disappointment, he failed to find a match
in his pockets.</p>

<p>As he was wondering what he could do, the unknown
made a sudden spring and tried to fling him off.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t!&#8221; hissed Don, again grappling with the
fellow. &#8220;I&#8217;m not done with you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The struggle was resumed with greater fury than before,
for the mysterious visitor to the dressing-room
seemed perfectly frantic in his desire to break from
Scott&#8217;s grasp and make his escape. They squirmed and
twisted and thrashed about on the floor, both panting
heavily.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;s fighting blood was aroused, as he had recovered
from the startled shock that assailed him when he discovered
the intruder in the dressing-room, and somehow
he took almost a fierce joy in this savage fight in the
dark.</p>

<p>At last he found a grip on the throat of the unknown,
determined to choke the fellow into submission; but then
his antagonist struck out heavily, hitting Don&#8217;s shoulder
with something that caused a twinge of pain and produced
a ripping sound.</p>

<p>Instantly Scott released the other&#8217;s throat and grasped
his arm and wrist, assailed by the conviction and fear that
his foe was armed with a dangerous weapon. Down to
the hand of the unknown Don&#8217;s fingers slipped, and there
he found a knife securely clutched.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>Then he knew the fellow had struck at him with the
knife, which he had felt in his shoulder!</p>

<p>Having made this alarming discovery, Don held fast to
the hand that gripped the knife, not daring to release it
for a moment, as the fear of being stabbed was on him.
Up to the moment of finding the knife in the hand of the
unknown he had not fancied he was in deadly danger; but
now his blood was chilled by the horror of this struggle in
the dark with an antagonist desperate enough to use an
open knife, and his every energy was bent to the task of
wresting the weapon from his foe.</p>

<p>In the midst of this fearful struggle the active brain
of the boy pictured a tragic ending for himself. He fancied
that his antagonist would wrest his knife-hand free
and strike again and again with the keen blade, plunging
it to the hilt each time, which must soon bring an end to
the struggle. The night would pass, morning come, and
then the searchers would find the dead lad there in the
blood-bespattered dressing-room. His father and his aunt
would grieve, but he wondered how many others would
care.</p>

<p>This grewsome fancy seemed to give him tremendous
strength, for he slowly forced the fingers of the other to
unclasp from the handle of the knife. Once his hand
slipped and he felt the blade slash across his fingers, but
he did not pause to wonder how badly he was cut. Believing
he was now fighting for his life, he lost not a moment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>At last, with a fierce wrench, he forced the knife from
the hand of the unknown; but, having bent all his energies
in this direction, he had given no attention to the task of
holding his foe so he could not escape. With a sudden
twist, the fellow flung Don off, then scrambled up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; panted Don; but, giving no heed, the mysterious
fellow darted out through the open door and disappeared.</p>

<p>As soon as possible Don sprang up and followed him.
Outside the door, he halted in the darkness, looking to
the right and to the left, but seeing nothing of his foe.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s run for the gate,&#8221; thought the boy, and he made
a dash for the exit from the field.</p>

<p>As he reached the gate, he heard a scrambling and
knocking sound against the boards of the fence at the
farther side of the field, following which, for a single moment,
he fancied he saw a dark figure rise to the top of the
fence, being dimly discernible against the sky. An instant
later the figure was gone, and Don knew his unknown
antagonist had made good his escape.</p>

<p>But Don&#8217;s bleeding fingers held the knife he had
wrested from his mysterious foe.</p>

<small>THE TELL-TALE KNIFE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Filled with wonder and speculation over his unexpected
and thrilling adventure, Don returned to the dressing-room
where the desperate encounter had taken place. The
knife he had closed and slipped into his pocket, and he
wound a handkerchief around his cut and bleeding fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give something to know what this fellow was up
to,&#8221; he muttered, pausing outside the open door and shuddering
as he thought of what had lately taken place within
that room. &#8220;He fought like the very Old Scratch, but I
don&#8217;t think he tried to strike me with the knife till I got
him down and choked him. Wish I had a match.&#8221;</p>

<p>But another search through his pockets failed to bring
forth the article he desired, and so, not without a slight
shiver and drawing back, he again stepped into the darkness
of the dressing-room.</p>

<p>Knowing exactly where his clothes were hanging on a
peg against the wall, it was not difficult for him to find
them. Having hurriedly gathered them and flung them
over his arm, he lost little time in leaving the dressing-room,
for he could not cast off the feeling that he might
again be attacked in the darkness of that place.</p>

<p>Outside he paused long enough to close the door, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
fastened with a spring lock, after which he walked swiftly
from the inclosure, shutting the gate behind him.</p>

<p>As he reached the road, he heard the sound of voices,
causing him to pause and listen, upon which he made the
discovery that several persons were approaching from the
direction of the village. The voices sounded natural, too,
and he decided that, for some reason, a number of boys
were coming toward him.</p>

<p>Not wishing to be seen by them, he hurried across the
road and crouched behind a clump of bushes, which, together
with the darkness, completely hid him from view.</p>

<p>As the party approached, he recognized the voices and
learned that it was made up of Sterndale, Mayfair, Murphy
and Chatterton. Listening to their conversation, he
heard Mayfair say:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right about this thing, Sterndale, and it was a
good thought of yours, for we can take care of the stuff at
the club-rooms now, and everything will be safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mesilf that nivver left anything up here at all, at
all,&#8221; declared the voice of the Irish lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he was so bub-bub-blamed mad over it that there&#8217;s
no tut-tut-telling wh-what he might do,&#8221; stuttered Chatterton.
&#8220;I ru-ruther think you&#8217;ve got a right to tut-try
somebody else in his pup-pup-pup-position, Sterndale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had my eye on Carter for some time,&#8221; the hidden
lad plainly heard the captain of the eleven declare. &#8220;He
doesn&#8217;t mingle with our crowd much, but he&#8217;s a strong,
hearty fellow, and he may prove to be a good man.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>They passed on and proceeded straight to the gate of
the fenced-in grounds. A moment later the sound of their
voices told they had entered by the gate and were within
the grounds, upon which Don rose from his place of concealment,
reached the road and hastened toward home.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were talking about me!&#8221; he grated. &#8220;So they&#8217;re
going to put Harry Carter in my place! He&#8217;s a fellow
who never seemed to take much interest in baseball or
anything else of the sort, yet they think he&#8217;ll be as good a
man as I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>From the disconnected and incomplete bit of conversation
that had reached his ears, he reasoned that the boys
must have been speaking of him; but just why they were
visiting the ball ground at that hour was a question he
could not answer. He had permitted all the suspicion,
selfishness and jealousy of his nature to be aroused, and
he fancied his erstwhile companions were ready to do anything
to &#8220;spite&#8221; him.</p>

<p>His nerves were far from steady, which was not at all
strange, taking into consideration the unexpected and violent
struggle from which he had recently emerged. The
mystery of that encounter continued to bewilder him, but
he decided that the unknown must have been a common
thief who had entered the dressing-room for the purpose
of securing whatever plunder he could discover there.</p>

<p>Under any condition, Don thanked his lucky stars that
he had escaped with his life, for the fellow had been fierce
in his final efforts to strike with the open knife, having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
found the athletic boy was more than a master for him.
Up to that time it appeared that his sole desire was to
break from Don&#8217;s grasp and escape; but, on being thrown
down and choked, he had used the knife.</p>

<p>Don wondered when the unknown had drawn and
opened the knife. It seemed that the rascal had scarcely
been given time to accomplish such an action after Don&#8217;s
entrance, for the boy had kept him busy, and he had
struggled madly to free himself and escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he had that open knife in his hand when I
came in on him,&#8221; Don finally decided.</p>

<p>So busy was he with his thoughts that he did not observe
his handkerchief had slipped from his wounded
fingers. He was nearly home when he made the discovery,
finding his hand was wet and sticky with blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the old handkerchief go,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll find
out how much I&#8217;m cut.&#8221;</p>

<p>He succeeded in entering the house quietly, and was
hurrying up to his room, when his father called to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you, Don?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were in bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am just going to bed now, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not wish to stand before his father again that
day, for he felt that he could not carry out his determination
to make a confession of the truth, and a discovery of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
his injury might lead Dr. Scott to ask him unpleasant
questions.</p>

<p>In his room, he flung his clothes over the back of a
chair, hurriedly washed the blood from his hand, and examined
his fingers, finding that three of them had been
cut, but not seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can attend to them myself,&#8221; he said, and he proceeded
to do so, taking from a drawer an old handkerchief,
which he tore into strips to bind about the bleeding
digits.</p>

<p>When this was done, Don took off his coat and discovered
in the left sleeve a long slit from the shoulder
nearly to the elbow, made by the knife of his antagonist
that now lay in his pocket.</p>

<p>This wound in his shoulder proved to be scarcely more
than a scratch, and he easily attended to that with some
strips of plaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he came near fixing that arm!&#8221; he exclaimed, picking
up his coat and looking at the slit in the sleeve. &#8220;Jupiter!
Just see that! My best coat, too! What can I tell
Aunt Ella? It won&#8217;t do to tell her just how it happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>Happening to glance at a mirror, he found his face was
very pale and that he still showed signs of agitation. He
also noted that his handsome red necktie was gone, having,
without doubt, been torn off in the encounter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to lose that necktie,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I ought to
go back, and look for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at that moment he heard his father close and lock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
the front door, and he knew the house was being shut up
for the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look for it in the morning,&#8221; he decided. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
likely I could find it to-night, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having flung himself down on an easy-chair, he fell to
thinking the entire adventure over from start to finish, it
being of a nature to take his mind for the time from his
trouble with Renwood. When he had reviewed it up to
the moment when he concealed himself behind the bushes
on the approach of four members of the village eleven, he
speculated again over the cause of their visit to the football
field at that hour of the night. Then he remembered
that Mayfair had spoken of their being able to take care of
some &#8220;stuff&#8221; at the club-rooms, and all at once it dawned
on him that they were proceeding to the dressing-room
under the grand-stand with the intention of removing to
the club-rooms the paraphernalia and suits of the football
team.</p>

<p>Then his face hardened, and he sprang to his feet as he
thought of Chatterton&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they had an idea that, because I was angry, I might
do some sneaky thing!&#8221; he snarled, his eyes flashing. &#8220;I
wonder what they thought I&#8217;d do? Did they fancy I&#8217;d
steal the football and suits? That little cub, Chatterton,
said I was so mad there was no telling what I&#8217;d do! I&#8217;d
like to wring his neck!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>The village stammerer might have been handled roughly
had he been within reach of Don Scott at that moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know what cause any one has to think such
things of me?&#8221; the doctor&#8217;s son muttered, walking up and
down the room with quick, nervous strides. &#8220;Even if I
have a temper, I&#8217;ve never played the sneak, and no one
has a right to even suspect that I&#8217;ll begin now!&#8221;</p>

<p>For a time these outraged thoughts prevented his mind
from reverting again to the encounter with the unknown,
but at length he came back to that, and once more fell to
wondering over the identity of his mysterious antagonist.
Then he thought of the captured knife, being seized by a
sudden hope that it might reveal to him what he wished to
know, or, at least, serve as a clew.</p>

<p>In a moment the knife was in his hand. It was covered
with blood, and this Don proceeded to wash away, wiping
the knife dry with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jupiter! it&#8217;s a beauty!&#8221; he exclaimed, regarding it
with admiration. &#8220;New, pearl-handled, four-bladed;
don&#8217;t look as if it&#8217;d be carried for a deadly weapon by a
ruffian; looks more like a gentleman&#8217;s knife. Hello!
Here are the initials of the owner engraved on the plate in
the handle. What are they? &#8216;R. G. R.&#8217; Now, what do
they stand for?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, staring at the handsome
knife that lay in his uninjured hand. Of a sudden, he
panted:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>&#8220;By my life, I have it! Those initials stand for Randolph
Grant Renwood, and this knife belongs to Dolph
Renwood!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, seemingly bewildered by this startling discovery,
he sat down and continued to stare at the tell-tale knife.</p>

<small>SIGNS OF GUILT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It is stating the case tamely to say Don was bewildered,
for that does not at all express his state of mind. He was
thunderstruck. Never till the moment of the surprising
discovery had he in any way connected his desperate antagonist
of the dressing-room with the lad whom he hated
with all the intensity of his passionate nature, and even
now it did not seem possible that the fellow who had
fought him so furiously in the darkness of that place could
have been Renwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it was he, what was he doing there?&#8221; was the question
Don asked himself. &#8220;He must have been up to something
crooked, else he would not have been so fierce to get
away; but what it means is more than I can conceive.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long time the boy puzzled over the singular affair,
without, however, in the least satisfying himself concerning
it. The knife that had fallen into his possession in
such a strange manner seemed to settle the identity of his
antagonist, but it did not betray Renwood&#8217;s reason for
secretly visiting the dressing-room under cover of darkness
or reveal why he had fought like a wolf to escape
without being recognized.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, he tried to stab me,&#8221; muttered Don. &#8220;Is it
possible he went there to steal my clothes? Perhaps he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
did, and it may be that he recognized me, even though I
didn&#8217;t recognize him. That may be why he fought so and
tried to stab me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was not satisfied with this explanation, and at last,
tired of speculating concerning it, he went to bed. After
what he had passed through, it was but natural that he
should dream, nor was it strange that his dreams were of
sanguine encounters with the lad he so disliked.</p>

<p>Don slept late the following morning, which was the
Sabbath; but he was aroused at last by his aunt outside his
door, who told him he would have to make haste in order
to get ready for church.</p>

<p>Of course, his first waking thoughts were of the unpleasant
events of the previous day and the startling adventure
which had capped them all. As he dressed the
tell-tale knife lay on a table before him, and his eyes often
sought it, while his heart was filled with triumph because
he had, he fancied, wrested from his enemy&#8217;s hand this
proof of his identity.</p>

<p>Don gave his aunt no cause to complain about his appetite
that morning, for he ate heartily; but there was a flush
in his dark cheeks and his manner was strangely preoccupied,
showing that his thoughts were wandering. However,
he was thoughtful enough to keep his injured hand
in his lap, so it did not attract attention.</p>

<p>The second bell was ringing when Don came down from
his room to join his father and aunt, who were waiting
for him to accompany them to church.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>&#8220;Hello, Don!&#8221; exclaimed the doctor. &#8220;You have forgotten
to put on your best coat. That one doesn&#8217;t match
your suit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don was confused, for he had hoped his father or aunt
would not notice this, and he halted a bit as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll wear this coat to-day, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you? The other coat looks better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;my other coat is&mdash;I can&#8217;t wear it to-day,&#8221; blundered
the lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t wear it? Why not? What is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ve torn it,&#8221; declared Don, feeling his face burning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Torn it? That&#8217;s too bad! How did it happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I caught the sleeve on a nail,&#8221; fabricated the desperate
lad, thus for the first time in his life telling-his father an
outright falsehood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; smiled the doctor, thinking his son&#8217;s confusion
rose from his reluctance to confess that he had thus
damaged his best coat, &#8220;accidents will happen, my boy.
We all meet such misfortunes occasionally.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don felt mean enough, and he regretted that he had
thought of trying to hide the truth from his father, even
though telling it might have led to a complete confession
of his utter failure in the attempt to master his temper.
His outraged conscience troubled and tortured him till he
imagined guilt and shame must be written on his face so
that all could see it and understand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>With this thought in his mind, he followed his father
and aunt into the church, his face flushed and his eyes
downcast. As he was about to pass through the second
door, he distinctly heard these whispered words:</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is! Look at him!&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes and saw a short distance away Dick
Sterndale and Dolph Renwood, both gazing straight at
him.</p>

<p>Scott&#8217;s face had been red before, but now there was
such a rush of blood to his head that it actually turned
purple. Involuntarily, he half lifted his wounded hand
which had wrested the betraying knife from his antagonist,
but the bandaged fingers were hidden by a glove,
which he had succeeded in wearing, for all the difficulty
in drawing it on. Then he passed on into the church, but
with the desire strong upon him to confront and accuse
his foe then and there.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did it,&#8221; said Sterndale, grimly, when Don had vanished.
&#8220;His face gave him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to think it of him even now,&#8221; Renwood
declared, in a low tone. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the fellow, but I
didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d stoop to such a dirty trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more did I think so, but his nasty temper led him
into it. He betrayed his guilt plainly enough when he
saw us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make him settle for the damage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he refuses&mdash;what then?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>&#8220;His father&#8217;ll have a chance to settle. Somebody must
pay for last night&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they followed Don into the church.</p>

<p>To the doctor&#8217;s son it seemed that the sermon was aimed
directly at him, and all through the discourse he sat with
his cheeks alternately flushing and paling, looking neither
to the right nor left. The text, taken from Revelations,
was a body blow, causing the uncomfortable boy to start
when it fell on his ears: &#8220;All liars shall have their part in
the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.&#8221; The
preacher was relentless in his denunciation of hypocrites
and liars, so that Don was relieved to escape from the
church when it was all over.</p>

<p>When he found himself alone at home, he sought to
salve his wounded conscience and palliate his deception of
his father by declaring to himself that he was not to blame
for a falsehood that had been forced from him by such a
combination of circumstances, and which he had told in
order to avert the pain and distress which the truth might
bring upon the doctor. The blame for this act he sought
to shift upon his enemy, who had driven him into such a
strait.</p>

<p>Not that Don had never before perpetrated a deception
or uttered anything savoring of untruth, for, like the average
boy, he was not perfect in this respect, but, up to this
time, his intercourse with his father, whom he held in
such deep affection, had been absolutely honest and truthful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
for which reason the falsehood was like a poisoned
arrow rankling in a wound.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got to keep it up, now that I&#8217;ve commenced
it,&#8221; he told himself.</p>

<p>And thus it was that the first false step led to others, as
almost unfailingly happens.</p>

<p>That afternoon Don sought to forget his troubles by
reading, and for the purpose he resorted to one of Trowbridge&#8217;s
most thrilling books, &#8220;Cudjo&#8217;s Cave.&#8221; Absorbed
by the breathless flight of Penn, Virginia and Cudjo
through the burning forest, he failed for some time to hear
the whistled signal that came from beneath his window or
the tiny pebbles that clinked against the panes.</p>

<p>At last, however, having reached the hair-raising climax
of the chapter, where the fear-crazed horse, bearing the
unknown rider, plunges crashing into the depths of the
dark ravine, he paused to take a long breath and heard
both the whistle and the rattle against the window.</p>

<p>Looking out, he discovered Leon Bentley below. A
moment later the window was open and Leon was saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Just going to give it up. Thought you must be asleep
or dead. Come down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come up,&#8221; invited Don. &#8220;Father is out and Aunt Ella
is lying down. I&#8217;ll let you in by the back door.&#8221;</p>

<p>His resolution to break with Bentley was forgotten,
and, for the first time, he admitted the disreputable fellow
to his home and his room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.<br />


<small>WHO DID IT?</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Say, this is comfortable,&#8221; remarked Leon, flinging
himself upon the easiest chair and elevating his polished
russet shoes to the top of a small table. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a
slick den here, though I don&#8217;t like your pictures much, and
I don&#8217;t see what you want of so many books. It&#8217;s a bother
to read books, and the pictures in my room are of the dead
game sort. Got &#8217;em out of the sporting papers, you know.
The walls are pretty near covered by pictures of prize-fighters,
fast trotters and sporting men. Excuse me if I
smoke. I&#8217;m dying for a whiff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without further words, he pulled out a package and
selected a cigarette, which he coolly prepared and lighted.
He was returning the package to his pocket, when Don
held out a hand, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;ll try one of those things just for fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bentley let his feet fall from the top of the table to the
floor, stared a moment at his companion, then handed over
the cigarettes, laughing:</p>

<p>&#8220;That came near knocking me out. You were so set
against cigarettes yesterday that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You fancied I&#8217;d never change my mind. There is an
old saying, &#8216;it&#8217;s only a fool who never changes his mind.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>Don lighted one of the cigarettes, while Leon watched
him with a sly, satisfied smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may not like the first one very much,&#8221; said the
inveterate smoker, &#8220;but you&#8217;ll find they&#8217;ll grow on ye, and
you will like them more and more, till, after a while, you
won&#8217;t want to get along without them. I tell you they are
great stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the lighting of that first cigarette, a reckless sensation
of indifference stole over Don, and he began to feel
that, considering the circumstances, he had not done anything
worth worrying about in deceiving his father and
telling him a falsehood. In a few moments he was telling
himself that cigarettes truly were, as Leon had declared,
soothing to the nerves.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not so bad,&#8221; admitted Don; &#8220;but I&#8217;ll have to
give this room a good airing, so aunt will not smell the
smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you better not smoke too much of the first one,&#8221;
Leon warned, craftily. &#8220;As you&#8217;re not used to &#8217;em, it
might make your head feel queer. After a while, if you
keep it up, you can smoke as many as you like without
noticing it at all. In fact, one or two will be just no satisfaction;
more of an aggravation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long had you been outside?&#8221; asked the doctor&#8217;s
son.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten minutes, anyhow. I wanted to have a talk with
you. I&#8217;d come over last night after leaving the club, but
I thought you&#8217;d be abed. I wanted to tell you about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
nasty trick this fellow Renwood is playing on me. I knew
he had it in for me, and I tumbled in a minute when Sterndale
proposed giving Harry Carter a trial in the line. I
pinned him right down and asked him where he proposed
trying Carter. When he said right or left tackle I knew
what that meant, for Linton is solid as right tackle. If
Carter shows up all right, I&#8217;m to be kicked out, and Carter
goes in as left tackle. Renwood is at the bottom of it, the
dirty cad!&#8221;</p>

<p>His companion&#8217;s words brought a feeling of surprise to
Don Scott, who immediately recalled the broken bit of
conversation he had overheard the previous evening as he
crouched behind some bushes directly after leaving the
football field. Hearing Sterndale speaking at that time of
giving Carter a trial on the eleven, he had felt certain the
new man was to be given the position made vacant by his
resignation from the team; but now Bentley&#8217;s statement
seemed to cast a new light on the captain&#8217;s intention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you&#8217;re right, Bent?&#8221; asked the doctor&#8217;s
son, earnestly. &#8220;Perhaps they&#8217;re not going to drop you;
they may mean to give you another position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on your life! When I tumbled to the game, I just
demanded to know what Sterndale meant to do, and I
forced him to declare himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How? What did he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he said he&#8217;d keep me if Carter did not prove to
be a better man. As if he thought I&#8217;d stand that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;I told him just what I thought about it. I gave him
a piece of my mind, and don&#8217;t you forget it! I told him
I was done with his old football team the moment he
dropped me off to give Carter or any other fellow a trial
in my position. I tell you, I was mad! Then I got out
and left them to do anything they liked. Now that you&#8217;re
not going on the team, Scott, I don&#8217;t believe I care a rap
about playing with that gang.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leon made this final declaration in a manner which
seemed to indicate that he regarded Don as his particular
friend, for which reason, as Don had been treated shabbily,
he was more than willing to withdraw from the eleven.</p>

<p>As he crouched behind the bushes near the football field,
Don had heard Chatterton speak of somebody as being
angry enough to do almost anything, and the listening lad
then fancied the stammerer was referring to him; but now
it seemed possible that quite another person had been the
subject of the remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a talk with Chatterton a while ago,&#8221; Leon went
on, &#8220;and I tried to pump him about Sterndale&#8217;s intention
in regard to me, but he pretended not to know what the
fellow is going to do. But, say! he told me something that
pretty near took my wind. You can&#8217;t guess what happened
last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t try to guess. What did happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody went into the dressing-room under the
grand-stand and raised the dickens generally.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>Don felt his heart give a great jump, but he tried to assume
an appearance of calmness as he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Raised the dickens how? What did he do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know some of the fellows left their suits there,
and the football was left there, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, somebody went in there and took a knife and slit
the suits into ribbons and slashed the football all to
pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don sprang to his feet with a cry, for Bentley&#8217;s words
solved a mystery that had puzzled him greatly, and now
he knew why it was that the fellow detected by him in the
dressing-room had fought so fiercely to escape without
being recognized.</p>

<p>Leon stared in surprise at his companion, whose face
flushed and paled and who seemed to be shaking with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who did it?&#8221; panted Don. &#8220;Does Chatterton know?
Who was sneak enough to do such a trick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked Chat if he knew, and he winked and said they
had found proofs enough to hang the fellow who did the
job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of proof?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t tell me. He said the chap must have cut
himself, for there was blood on the floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don wondered if his visitor had observed his bandaged
fingers; but, if so, Leon made no sign.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>The doctor&#8217;s son walked to the window and looked out.
Having opened the window, he turned back, and there
seemed to be a look of triumph on his dark face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bentley,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have you a suspicion who did that
job?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got a sneaking notion,&#8221; answered Leon,
with a foxy smile, as he lighted a fresh cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom do you suspect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I questioned Chatterton pretty closely,&#8221; declared Bentley,
wagging his head, &#8220;and I found out another fellow
left the club-room directly after I did. It is my opinion
that he&#8217;s none too good to do such a trick, and I&#8217;ll bet
they&#8217;ll find it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody you and I love&mdash;I don&#8217;t think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Renwood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Bentley&#8217;s surprise, his companion sat down, a sudden
look of doubt and perplexity dawning on his face and
growing swiftly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What reason have you to think Renwood would do
such a thing?&#8221; questioned Don. &#8220;What could be his
object?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard something to-day that&#8217;s given me an idea.
Renwood is acquainted with Winston, the Harvard man,
who is coaching Highland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought all the time that Renwood didn&#8217;t care a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
snap whether Rockspur won or not, and now I&#8217;ll bet my
life he&#8217;s working to have us lose to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I fail to see his object,&#8221; declared Don. &#8220;Why
should he want Rockspur to lose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may come out later. If he is a particular friend
of this Winston, he may be playing into Winston&#8217;s hands.
Perhaps Winston wants to win a reputation as a coach;
perhaps he&#8217;s expecting to bet money on the game; perhaps
a lot of things. Anyhow, I&#8217;ll bet my pile that Renwood
and Winston have it put up between them to down Rockspur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don shook his head. A short time before he had been
eager to believe anything bad of Renwood; but, for all
that, he was not satisfied with Bentley&#8217;s explanation of
Dolph&#8217;s reasons for invading the dressing-room and destroying
the football and suits.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see how such a trick would do him any good,&#8221;
averred the logical Don. &#8220;If he wants to make a lot of
flub players out of the Rockspur crowd, so they will lose
the game, I should think he could find a better way to
carry out his purpose. To me it seems that the destruction
of the suits and football was a piece of petty spite,
and, much as I&#8217;d like to, I can&#8217;t see any reason for such
spite on the part of Renwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t think he did it?&#8221; asked Bentley, in a
disappointed way.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;s eyes fell on something that lay upon the table,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
half concealed by a magazine, and he suddenly sprang to
his feet once more, snatching up this object and crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe he did the job, even though I can&#8217;t understand
why, and here in my hand is the proof against
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>He displayed the handsome knife he had wrested from
his antagonist of the previous night.</p>

<p>At sight of that knife Leon Bentley gave a start and
turned pale.</p>

<small>DON ACCUSES RENWOOD.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Don could scarcely fail to observe his companion&#8217;s
strange agitation and pallor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; he exclaimed, wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That knife!&#8221; gasped Leon. &#8220;Where did you get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He snatched it from Don&#8217;s hand and examined it closely,
his fingers trembling a little, while his whole manner
betrayed both astonishment and dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever seen that knife before?&#8221; questioned the
dark-haired boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;why, I believe I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When? Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&mdash;er&mdash;saw it last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did? Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the club-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who had it?&#8221; cried Don, clutching Bentley fiercely by
the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; begged the other lad, squirming and dropping
his cigarette. &#8220;Great C&aelig;sar! you hurt! Your fingers feel
like iron!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who had that knife?&#8221; Don again demanded. &#8220;If you
saw it in the club-room, you must have seen it in the possession
of some one. Who had it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&mdash;it&#8217;s Renwood&#8217;s knife.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>&#8220;How do you know? Did you see it in his possession?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure? Are you sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m sure, for I took it from him and examined it
before all the other fellows. I told him I&#8217;d like to have a
knife like that, and then I passed it back to him, and he
took it. All the fellows saw me give it back to him,&#8221; Leon
concluded, impressively.</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles it!&#8221; grated the doctor&#8217;s son, his eyes flashing
and his face betraying triumphant satisfaction. &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad they all saw this knife in that fellow&#8217;s possession and
that he claimed it as his own. Even though I cannot
understand his motive for doing the dirty job in the dressing-room,
there is no longer a doubt in my mind but he
did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bentley drew a long breath, looked wonderfully relieved,
and a bit of color returned to his sallow cheeks. Had Don
Scott been watching his visitor closely, he must have wondered
somewhat at his manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how that knife came into your possession is more
than I can understand,&#8221; said Leon, picking up his half-smoked
cigarette and looking at Don askance.</p>

<p>Then Scott told him the whole story of his adventure
in the dressing-room the night before, and the other listened
attentively, but with his eyes downcast, at times
gnawing at his lips in a nervous manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;That beats the world!&#8221; he muttered, when the story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
was finished. &#8220;But I think it&#8217;s a mighty unlucky thing
that you turned up there last night, old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unlucky?&#8221; cried Don. &#8220;How is that? Didn&#8217;t I catch
the fellow right in the act?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but it might have been better if you had not
caught him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand. How could it have been better?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&mdash;er&mdash;perhaps he might have&mdash;left a&mdash;a clew&mdash;there
in the dressing-room,&#8221; faltered Leon, lamely.
&#8220;He might have dropped the knife, you know, and&mdash;er&mdash;forgotten
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all likely! If I hadn&#8217;t come on him just as I
did, he&#8217;d done the job and got away without leaving a
trace. No one could have sworn who did it, and any one
else might have been suspected. Why, they might have
suspected me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but you&#8217;re right,&#8221; slowly admitted Bentley;
&#8220;still, something tells me it would have been better if
you hadn&#8217;t run onto him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;re daffy!&#8221; laughed Don, his eyes gleaming.
&#8220;I have the fellow&mdash;have him foul!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m going to expose him! I&#8217;m going to show
him up to the boys! I&#8217;ll show them what sort of a chap
they have as coach for the eleven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Bentley; &#8220;but what if they don&#8217;t
believe your story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have to believe it! Here&#8217;s the knife, and here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
are my fingers, cut in the struggle with him. More than
that,&#8221; he went on, striding quickly to the clothes-press,
&#8220;here is my coat, with a slit from the shoulder to the
elbow, just as he made it when he tried to stab me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held up the coat, and the visitor regarded it with no
small amount of curiosity, whistling softly and observing:</p>

<p>&#8220;By gracious! he did come near carving you up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he knew me!&#8221; Don savagely declared. &#8220;He
must have recognized me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! it was so dark in there that a fellow couldn&#8217;t
recognize any one&mdash;at least, you said it was,&#8221; Leon hastily
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, I believe he knew me, and that was why he tried
to cut me. I&#8217;ll square the account with him! Wait till I
show him up to-morrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you succeed,&#8221; said Bentley, sincere in
that wish, at least. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll be going. Your old man
might come home, and I have a notion he doesn&#8217;t like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don did not object to the departure of his visitor, and,
having lighted another cigarette, Leon left, as he had entered,
by the back door.</p>

<p>Don could scarcely wait for the following day, so eager
was he to denounce Renwood. He pictured to himself
the sensation his revelation would create, and in his mind
he saw his enemy an outcast, scorned and taunted and
shunned by the village lads.</p>

<p>It was barely eight o&#8217;clock the following morning when
Don passed the fountain in the village square, being on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
way to a grocery store to take an order for his aunt before
starting for school. As he came out of the store, Dick
Sterndale called to him from the opposite side of the
street:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come over here, Scott, I want to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re the very fellow I&#8217;m looking for,&#8221; said Don,
promptly crossing over.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to come to the club-room for a short time,
Scott,&#8221; the captain of the eleven grimly declared, regarding
Don in anything but a pleasant manner.</p>

<p>They climbed the stairs, Dick falling in behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;He means to give me a call-down for my talk to Renwood,&#8221;
thought the boy in advance, feeling in his pocket
for the captured knife. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make him change his tune in
a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reaching the club-rooms, they found Mayfair and Chatterton
there, both of whom regarded Don coldly, not even
nodding to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you want of me, Sterndale?&#8221; demanded
the dark-haired lad, ignoring the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a few questions to ask you,&#8221; said Dick, ominously,
closing the door behind them; &#8220;and it&#8217;s best for you to
tell the truth, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not in the habit of lying!&#8221; flared the doctor&#8217;s son,
his face turning crimson; &#8220;and I won&#8217;t take an insinuation
of the sort from you or anybody else, Dick Sterndale!
You want to be careful!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>He was scowling fiercely, but the captain of the eleven,
regardless of his threatening manner, sharply asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you go directly after leaving this room last
night, Scott?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s any of your business,&#8221; retorted
Don, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t mind telling you. I went home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you remain there?&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden sensation of danger assailed Don, and his
eyes swiftly scanned the faces of Sterndale and his companions.
He discovered that he was being regarded with
cold scorn, and an intimation of their thoughts fell upon
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Sterndale,&#8221; he said, quickly, turning to the
captain, &#8220;if you have anything to say to me, just say it at
once, without beating round the bush. What are you
driving at?&#8221;</p>

<p>From behind the door the captain took down three football
suits that had been cut and slashed into ribbons, and
he kicked out before Don the remains of a football which
had been destroyed in a similar manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know anything about this job?&#8221; asked Dick,
sternly and accusingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were somewhat surprised by Don&#8217;s answer, and
Chatterton whispered to Mayfair:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bub-bub-by Jinks! he&#8217;s gug-going to own up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you do?&#8221; exclaimed Sterndale. &#8220;Well, what do
you know about it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>&#8220;I know who did it,&#8221; declared Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt about that,&#8221; muttered Mayfair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221; demanded Dick, watching Scott closely.</p>

<p>Just then footsteps sounded outside and the door
opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;That fellow there!&#8221; rang out Don&#8217;s clear voice, as his
finger was pointed accusingly at Dolph Renwood, who
stood in the doorway.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br />


<small>CHARGE AND COUNTERCHARGE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Don&#8217;s bold accusation astounded those who heard it, for
it was wholly unexpected. Renwood seemed amazed,
Mayfair and Chatterton sprang to their feet, and Sterndale
uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the sneak who did the dirty work!&#8221; cried the
doctor&#8217;s son. &#8220;He can&#8217;t deny it! He slashed those suits
and destroyed that football!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar!&#8221; retorted Dolph, quick as a flash.</p>

<p>It was well that Sterndale was between them instantly,
else Don might have broken his promise to Renwood&#8217;s
sister. Finding Dick there, he restrained himself, laughed
harshly and triumphantly, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right; I can afford to take it off you just
now. In short order I&#8217;ll show you up as both a liar and a
sneak. You followed me from this room last night, and
you can&#8217;t deny that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to deny it. What if I did?&#8221; said Dolph.</p>

<p>&#8220;From here you went directly to the dressing-room
under the grand-stand, where you used your handsome
pearl-handled knife to slash these suits and cut up the
football. Why you did such a low, sneaking trick is more
than I can understand, unless you were possessed by the
Old Boy himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Renwood laughed derisively.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;You have more gall than any fellow I ever saw!&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;I compliment you on your nerve, Mr. Scott!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know he had such a thing as a pearl-handled
knife?&#8221; asked Sterndale.</p>

<p>&#8220;That knife slashed the sleeve of my best coat from
shoulder to elbow,&#8221; answered Don. &#8220;That knife cut these
fingers,&#8221; and he displayed his bandaged digits. &#8220;That
knife is in my possession!&#8221;</p>

<p>With the final words, he took the knife from his pocket
and held it up before them all, causing every one of them
to utter exclamations of surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him deny that it is his knife if he can!&#8221; challenged
the dark-haired lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least notion of denying it,&#8221; said Dolph,
immediately. &#8220;It is my knife, lost last Saturday night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, lost in the struggle with me in the dressing-room,
where I caught you just after you had finished your dirty
work of cutting up the football and the suits. I left this
suit of clothes I am wearing there Saturday afternoon, and
I went up for it that night, after I was here in this room.
I caught you there, and you fought like a fiend to escape
without being recognized. When I had you down and
was choking you into submission, you tried to stab me with
the knife, and you did cut my shoulder a bit, but I got hold
of your hand and took the knife from you. Here it is, and
it is proof that you are the fellow I found in the dressing-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don seemed to fancy that he had fastened the deed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Renwood, and his air was one of satisfied triumph; but he
was surprised to observe that Dolph showed neither confusion
nor shame. Instead, the city youth laughed again,
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very clever fairy story, Scott, but you can&#8217;t
make anybody believe it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; agreed Mayfair. &#8220;It will not go down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not mum-much!&#8221; scoffed Chatterton.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had not confessed being in the dressing-room
Saturday night,&#8221; said Sterndale, regarding Don with mingled
anger and aversion, &#8220;we had sufficient evidence to
show you were there. We found this in the dressing-room.&#8221;
He held up to view Don&#8217;s favorite red necktie.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this just outside the gate to the field,&#8221; put in Mayfair,
displaying a blood-stained handkerchief. &#8220;It has
your monogram on it, Scott.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both necktie and handkerchief are mine,&#8221; declared
Don, without hesitation. &#8220;The necktie was torn off in
the struggle. I had the handkerchief wrapped about my
fingers, but lost it on the way home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sus-sus-slick yarn,&#8221; commented Danny, while the
others, with the exception of Sterndale, smiled scornfully.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, Don realized that his words had
fallen on unbelieving ears and his attempt to expose the
villainy of Renwood was a complete failure. More than
that, it was plain to him that circumstantial evidence had
convinced these fellows that he was the dastardly sneak
who had destroyed the football and ruined the suits.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>For a moment he turned pale; then all the fury of his
fiery nature burst forth, and he raved against them like a
person bereft of reason. His eyes glared and a white froth
formed on his lips, while he shook all over. It seemed that
in his senseless rage he would attack them all, but he did
not.</p>

<p>The boys were awed by the spectacle, though Sterndale
remained grave and firm, his face expressing no emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fools!&#8221; snarled Don. &#8220;You&#8217;re blind! Think I tore
off my own necktie and left it behind so you might know
I&#8217;d been there? How do you suppose I came into possession
of that fellow&#8217;s knife unless I obtained it just as I&#8217;ve
stated?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was easy,&#8221; declared Renwood himself. &#8220;I had
the knife Saturday evening just before you entered this
room, and I was sitting on that table over there. The
knife was beside me when you came in and walked over to
the table; when you left this room the knife was gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; nodded Mayfair. &#8220;We all hunted for it
and couldn&#8217;t find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now we nun-nun-know why we couldn&#8217;t fuf-fuf-find
it,&#8221; asserted Chatterton, wisely.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you think I stole it?&#8221; grated the dark-eyed lad,
showing his white teeth. &#8220;All right, think so, if you like!
What do I care! You&#8217;re a lot of fools, and you&#8217;ll find it
out before you are done with Renwood. As for him, he
had better look out for me! I know he did the sneaking
work Saturday night, and I will prove it against him so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
there will be no way for him to squirm out of it! Anyhow,
I&#8217;ll fix him, and you may bet your lives on that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Don flung the handsome pearl-handled knife on the
floor and started to walk from the room, Renwood having
left the doorway free; but Dick Sterndale blocked his passage,
putting out a strong hand to stop him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, Scott,&#8221; said the captain of the eleven, grimly.
&#8220;When are you going to pay for that football and those
suits?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lips of the doctor&#8217;s son curled with scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Never!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you will,&#8221; said Dick, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I do, I hope I may drop dead the next instant!&#8221;
panted Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do not,&#8221; warned the handsome fellow who
blocked his path, &#8220;your father will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? You&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you refuse to pay, I shall go to your father, tell him
the whole story and demand payment from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don caught his breath, and it seemed that he would assault
the captain then and there; but Sterndale showed no
wavering nor alarm, and the attack did not come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead!&#8221; grated the dark-eyed lad. &#8220;Go to my
father, if you like! You can&#8217;t drive me that way to pay
for damage I never did! I&#8217;ll die before I&#8217;ll pay one cent!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was plain enough that he meant it then, but Dick
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you will change your mind after you think it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
over. I&#8217;ll give you till to-night. If you do not agree to
pay by that time, I&#8217;ll call on your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped aside, and the suspected youth walked to the
door, where he turned for a last desperate fling at his
accusers. His hands were clenched, his face flushed and
his teeth showing as he looked back over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a soft crowd!&#8221; he sneered, with curling lips.
&#8220;If you were not, you wouldn&#8217;t be ready to get down and
crawl for a common city cad. Because his father has
some money and he is from Boston, you are ready to take
anything off him and believe any lie he tells. Oh, you
make me sick!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he went out.</p>

<small>IN THE AUTUMN WOODS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Don did not attend school that day, for he felt that he
could not study, and he wished to be alone. He set out
toward the academy, it is true, but kept on, paying no heed
to the boys and girls who were gathered in groups about
the steps and grounds of the white school building, passed
the fenced-in football field, and struck off by a path that
led toward the picnic grove in the vicinity of High Bluff.</p>

<p>The fields were showing brown in spots, while here and
there a tree was tinted with crimson and gold, the gorgeous
banners of advancing autumn. The sky was blue
and cloudless, the air clear and still, transmitting distant
sounds with a softened distinctness that was agreeable to
the ear, while over all seemed to hang the delightful,
dreamy languor that is typical of this season in the country.</p>

<p>Crickets were chirping merrily in the brown grass beside
the path that led the feet of the unhappy boy toward
the picnic grove, but he heard them not, for in his heart
there was a tumult that drowned all other sounds. From
a farm-yard far across the unrippled harbor sounded the
crowing of a cock, mellowed by the distance, but the
music of the sound did not seem to reach Don&#8217;s ears.</p>

<p>In the heart of the grove he found a mossy bed, upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
which he threw himself, giving way to the bitterest reflections.
He lay there while the forenoon slipped away.
Squirrels chattered in various parts of the grove. A mischievous-looking
little chipmunk perched on a stub a few
feet away and stared at the reclining lad, observing in an
inquiring manner: &#8220;Kuk? Kuk? Kuk?&#8221; A bluejay
lighted on a branch high above him, cocked its tufted head
to one side, and shrilly screamed: &#8220;Wake up! Get up!
Wake up! Come on!&#8221; Then, as the lad stirred, he shot
away like a blue arrow from a bow, wildly shrieking:
&#8220;Phe-phay! Phe-phay!&#8221;</p>

<p>These sights and sounds did not interrupt the tumultuous
flow of the boy&#8217;s thoughts, and he was not aroused till
the whistles of the mills far across the river told him that
the noon hour had arrived. Then he sprang to his feet
and hurried from the grove, making great haste to get
back to the village.</p>

<p>There was no one in the vicinity of the academy to observe
him as he reached it and scudded past, but he found
his aunt &#8220;sputtering&#8221; when he reached home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness sakes! where have you been?&#8221; she impatiently
exclaimed. &#8220;The other scholars went past twenty minutes
ago, and I had dinner all ready then. Everything
will be stone-cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I staid behind,&#8221; said Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; she questioned, curiously. &#8220;Was it something
about your lessons that kept ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>And he answered: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Having taken the first step<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
by deceiving his father and telling him a falsehood, he was
surprised to find how readily this untruth came from
his lips.</p>

<p>The doctor ate dinner with them, but his mind seemed
to be occupied, so that he talked very little, which was decidedly
to Don&#8217;s satisfaction.</p>

<p>Leon Bentley was loitering past the house when Don
came out, and he called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Scott, old man! Where were you this forenoon?
Didn&#8217;t see you at school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up, you idiot!&#8221; hissed Don, hurrying down the
steps and out to the sidewalk. &#8220;What do you want to
come round shouting like that for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ho!&#8221; grinned Leon. &#8220;I catch on! Don&#8217;t want
your old man to know, eh? Played hookey, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel like going to school to-day, and so I&#8217;m
not going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you mean to stay out this afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, say, I&#8217;m with you. Where&#8217;ll we go?&#8221;</p>

<p>Don was not at all pleased, for he did not desire Leon&#8217;s
company; but that made no difference to Leon, and, discovering
his companion was determined to hang on like a
leech, the doctor&#8217;s son said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going anywhere out of the village. I feel like getting
off by myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, say, let&#8217;s go over into the Powder Mill Woods.
I&#8217;ll get my rifle and we can have some fun popping at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
squirrels and birds. We might strike some partridges.
What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d as lief go there as anywhere, but I don&#8217;t care about
tramping all the way round by the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get a boat down by Nutt&#8217;s Wharf and row over.
Let&#8217;s turn round and go back for my rifle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going back, for we&#8217;ll meet somebody on the
way to the academy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I tell you what, you just go straight to the wharf,
and I&#8217;ll be along as soon as I can get that rifle. Will you
do that? Will you go to the wharf and wait for me
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something about Don&#8217;s manner of saying
this that made Leon suspicious, and he quickly demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean it? Will you really wait for me at the
wharf?&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly the dark-eyed lad blazed forth:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you take me for? Do you think I&#8217;m a liar,
same as all the others think? Didn&#8217;t I say I&#8217;d be there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, get your old rifle and come along! Hurry up
about it, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; breathed Leon, hastily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hustle, you
bet.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and ran down the street, while Don sullenly
walked on, in anything but a pleasant mood. At the first
corner, he turned to the left and made for the shore, considering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
himself lucky when he left the main streets of
the village without meeting any of the scholars besides
Bentley.</p>

<p>When Leon reached Nutt&#8217;s Wharf, he found Don sitting
on one of the old spiles, gazing moodily down into
the water that was eddying round the barnacle-encrusted
timbers. Hearing Bentley approaching, Don looked up, a
frown still on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, where&#8217;s your rifle?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you
get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; grinned Leon, unbuttoning his coat and
displaying a small rifle with a detachable stock. &#8220;I kept
it out of sight by tucking it under there. Just as well, for
I ran into some of the fellows, and they would have asked
questions if they&#8217;d seen it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, where&#8217;s your boat?&#8221; demanded Scott.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take Jeff Tyler&#8217;s old dory. I know where he
hides the oars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ask Jeff for her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of asking?&#8221; chuckled Bentley. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
used her more than once, and I never asked yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jeff might not like it if he knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do we care? He&#8217;ll never know, for he&#8217;s at work
over in Lobsterville. Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don followed Leon, who drew out the oars from their
place of concealment beneath some old timbers piled at
one end of the wharf, and then led the way round to the
tagging, slimy steps that enabled them to reach the dory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Don entered the boat first, Leon casting off the line and
springing in a moment later.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better not pull straight across,&#8221; said the doctor&#8217;s
son. &#8220;There goes the academy bell. We might be
seen, so let&#8217;s pull up the shore to Duffy&#8217;s Nose and keep
under the land till after school begins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Leon. &#8220;Go ahead. I&#8217;ve got to take
care of this rifle.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a pretense of disposing of the rifle, while Don
took the oars and rowed away up the shore. Bentley
lighted a cigarette and found a comfortable position in
the stern of the dory.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is great stuff,&#8221; he nodded, with satisfaction. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a corking day. A fellow&#8217;s a fool to mope away his time in
school on such a day as this. Say, you can&#8217;t guess what
the fellows said about you because you failed to show up
this forenoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t give a continental what they said!&#8221; snapped
Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;They said you were afraid,&#8221; grinned Leon, exhaling a
great breath of thin, blue smoke. &#8220;You stirred up a dickens
of a mess when you accused Renwood of doing that
job; but, say, didn&#8217;t he come back at you with both feet!
That must have jarred you some.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don had stopped rowing, and his face showed how his
companion&#8217;s words had aroused him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they say I&#8217;m afraid?&#8221; he muttered, bitterly. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
didn&#8217;t think about that. If I had thought&mdash;&mdash; But what
do I care what they say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t care, old man. I&#8217;m your friend,
and I&#8217;ll stick by you. If the whole town says you did that
trick, I&#8217;ll never believe it. I know better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leon said this with such evident earnestness that the
unfortunate youth could not help feeling gratitude and
showing it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Bent,&#8221; he said, his voice being a trifle
husky despite himself. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear you say that,
anyhow. I won&#8217;t forget it, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you are the kind to forget easily,&#8221; asserted
the crafty Leon. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be like you to forget
that I was the only one to stand by you and believe in you
when almost everybody turned against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I do not forget easily, and I&#8217;ll not forget Dolph
Renwood! My turn will come, and I&#8217;ll soak him when it
does! I suppose they were saying all manner of nasty
things about me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather. They said you put up a big bluff, but Sterndale
was sure you&#8217;d come round and cave in before night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never made a bigger mistake in his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he says he&#8217;s going to apply to your father for pay
for the football and suits if you don&#8217;t fork over. You
don&#8217;t want him to do that, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want him to, but I&#8217;ll never pay to keep him from
doing it. Not in a million years! If he thinks I will, he&#8217;ll
find he&#8217;s awfully mistaken.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>Don was rowing again, and he pulled the boat up under
the shelter of the high promontory known as Duffy&#8217;s
Nose, where they lingered till they knew the afternoon
session at the academy had begun. Then away across the
harbor the boat went, with Scott laboring at the oars and
Bentley lazily smoking in the stern. Into Crab Inlet they
steered, pulling up as far as the bridge across Powder
Mill Creek. Having tied the dory beneath the bridge,
where it would remain hidden from view, they set off on
foot toward the Old Powder Mill.</p>

<p>Leon put his rifle together and loaded it, having brought
along a supply of cartridges, and began to look round for
something to shoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind taking a shot at a sheep or a cow,
just for fun,&#8221; he grinned. &#8220;It would be sport just to wing
somebody&#8217;s old cow enough to make her run and kick
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fail to see where the fun would come in,&#8221; growled
Don.</p>

<p>At the Powder Mill Dam, where the water came rippling
over in a shining sheet, they lingered a while, and
Bentley fired at a swimming fish, but did not touch it.
Don would have been content to remain there longer, but
his companion was eager to plunge into the woods and
discover something to shoot.</p>

<p>The chatter of a squirrel caused Leon to hurry forward
eagerly. They came in sight of the squirrel after a
time, a handsome fellow, with a large, bushy tail, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Bentley began shooting, while Don looked on. After
Leon had fired four times, the squirrel scampered off and
disappeared, quite unharmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have my doubts about your being able to hit
a cow unless you put the muzzle of the rifle against her,&#8221;
said Don.</p>

<p>Leon flushed, chagrined at his ill success.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty good trick to hit a little object like a
squirrel with this kind of a rifle,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I bet
you can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see the fun in shooting squirrels, anyway,&#8221;
retorted Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t?&#8221; grinned Bentley, tauntingly. &#8220;That&#8217;s
because you know you can&#8217;t hit one. You don&#8217;t dare
to try.&#8221;</p>

<p>He continued to talk in this manner till they came
upon another squirrel, when he held out the rifle and invited
Don to show what he could do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out!&#8221; retorted the dark-eyed lad. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
to shoot him. See how handsome he looks, perched on
that limb with his tail up over his back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leon sneered and scoffed, persisting that Don did not
wish to shoot because he knew he could not hit the squirrel,
till, with an angry exclamation, the doctor&#8217;s son
caught the rifle from his companion&#8217;s hand, took careful
aim and fired.</p>

<p>From the limb an object dropped toward the ground,
which it struck with a sodden plump.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;You got him!&#8221; shouted Leon. &#8220;Why, you&#8217;re a crackajack!&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran forward, and Don followed slowly with the
rifle, a strange look on his face. There was a rustling
beneath the tree, and Bentley made a forward dive, crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Great smoke! he&#8217;s trying to get away! You broke
his back!&#8221;</p>

<p>The other boy stood still, his eyes following the crippled
squirrel that was trying to drag itself away to a
place of concealment. Leon headed off the wretched little
creature and began poking it about with a stick he
had picked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that!&#8221; snarled Don, springing at his companion,
with his eyes blazing. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you kill him? Can&#8217;t
you see he&#8217;s suffering?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he caught the stick from Leon&#8217;s hand and struck
the squirrel till the tiny animal lay motionless and dead
at his feet. This done, Don straightened up and stood
staring down at the work of his hand, his lips quivering
queerly, while something seemed to swell up in his
throat and almost choke him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoop-la!&#8221; shouted the other lad. &#8220;You&#8217;re a mighty
hunter and a dead shot, but I&#8217;ll bet you a quarter you
miss the next one you shoot at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take your old rifle!&#8221; palpitated Don, thrusting the
weapon at Leon. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t shoot at another one for
fifty dollars!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s sport!&#8221; laughed Leon. &#8220;That&#8217;s what we
came over here for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not sport for me, and I didn&#8217;t come here for anything
of the kind. I&#8217;m going back to the dam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now? Why, we&#8217;re going to hunt through the
woods for partridges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may go where you like,&#8221; said Don, turning
away. &#8220;When you get ready to go home, you&#8217;ll find me
down by the dam.&#8221;</p>

<p>His thin lips curling, Leon stared after Don, who
talked swiftly away. Bentley scornfully muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got a soft spot about him, after all, or he&#8217;d not
act that way over a common squirrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alone by the dam, Don lingered in the sunshine, listening
to the plashing water and the rustling whispers
of the wind amid the trees. His face, that had been hard
and angry, was sad and shaded with sincere regret.</p>

<small>TEMPTER AND TEMPTED.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What kind of an excuse are you going to make for
being absent from school?&#8221; asked Leon, as they were
pulling homeward across the harbor late that afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Don, shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to tell something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you do same as I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I just write an excuse for myself and take it to
old Alden. He never knows the difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think he could tell your writing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much! I imitate the old gent&#8217;s writing, and I bet
it would fool the old gent himself. Then I put his name
to it, and everything is all slick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; said Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might do it for yer, if I had a sample of your old
man&#8217;s penmanship. It would be dead easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t like to do anything like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a blamed sight better than being pulled over the
coals for playing hookey, I tell you. Tell you what, I&#8217;ll
come round this evening and whistle out back of your
house, and you can let me in, same as you did yesterday.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Then, if you want me to, and you can find something
your governor has written, I&#8217;ll fix you up an excuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t bother yourself. I shan&#8217;t want anything
of the kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; grinned Leon; &#8220;just as you say, old man.
But don&#8217;t give me away, so your dad will report that you
were out with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Down past Duffy&#8217;s Nose they slipped, creeping along
the shore toward Nutt&#8217;s Wharf, the oars clanking in the
rowlocks. Seeing no one in the vicinity of the wharf,
they pulled up to the steps and made the dory fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring the oars,&#8221; directed Leon, as, with the rifle buttoned
under his coat, he sprang out and started up the
steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back and get the oars, if you want them,&#8221; came
sharply from Don. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done the rowing, and now you
may take care of the old oars, or they&#8217;ll stay in the boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leon came back and took them as Scott passed them
out, observing:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in a jolly good temper! Any one &#8217;d never suspect
you&#8217;d been playing hookey and having a good time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t been having a good time,&#8221; muttered
the doctor&#8217;s son, as he followed his companion up the
steps.</p>

<p>He did not wait for Leon, but at once set off toward
home. As he reached the corner of Academy street, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
met Sterndale, who was coming down from the football
field.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment, Scott,&#8221; said Dick, stopping him. &#8220;I
want to know if you mean to pony up for that football
and those suits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I do,&#8221; flared Don, his face flaming red, &#8220;I hope
I&#8217;ll be struck by lightning!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better,&#8221; threatened the captain, grimly, &#8220;if you
don&#8217;t want me to go to your father at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to him, and be hanged! You can&#8217;t make me pay
for damage I didn&#8217;t do, Sterndale, and I didn&#8217;t do that
piece of dirty work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick&#8217;s eyes seemed trying to read his thoughts, as if
they would probe his very soul. With indignation, scorn
and defiance in his look, Don met his gaze squarely.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Scott,&#8221; said the big fellow, after a few moments.
&#8220;I did hope you would be reasonable, and you&#8217;ll
have no one but yourself to blame if your father learns
everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not a word in return for these did Don deign to speak,
but again went onward toward home, leaving Sterndale
staring after him in mingled anger and perplexity.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for Don to make excuses for arriving
home late, as he was in time for supper. He
found his father in a particularly agreeable humor, and
he was forced to simulate good nature himself, although
it was a difficult and repugnant task.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>&#8220;Well, my boy,&#8221; said the doctor, sipping his tea, &#8220;how
have things gone with you to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty well,&#8221; was the somewhat hesitating answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had to stay behind at noon on account of his
studies,&#8221; put in Don&#8217;s aunt. &#8220;That&#8217;s what made dinner
late. I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;s studying too hard, Lyman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; laughed Dr. Scott. &#8220;He likes outdoor
sports too well to let study do him any damage. He&#8217;s
one of the shining lights of the great Rockspur football
team, and I expect he&#8217;ll make a record to be proud of
when the eleven meets Highland.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don&#8217;s eyes were fastened on his plate, and he felt his
face beginning to burn.</p>

<p>&#8220;They do say that football is an awful game, Lyman,&#8221;
anxiously said Aunt Ella. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve read in the papers
about how many players get hurt at it every year. Now,
if Don should be killed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is not much danger of that,&#8221; assured the doctor,
still laughing. &#8220;He is training regularly, and he will
be in good condition for the game. A boy who studies
hard in school should be permitted to balance it up by
good, healthy sport out of school, and there is seldom any
danger that he will hurt himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was different when we were young&mdash;it was
different then,&#8221; sighed the good woman, pouring another
cup of tea. &#8220;Times have changed, Lyman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; nodded Don&#8217;s father, &#8220;for the better.
Don didn&#8217;t miss a day at school last term, and, unless he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
is ill, I do not expect him to miss a day this term. Now,
a lad who sticks to his studies like that deserves to be
indulged in his ambitions for athletic games that will
build up his body and strengthen him physically. If I
find an opportunity, I shall attend the first football game
in Rockspur, and so encourage the eleven by my presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don was feeling decidedly mean and wretched when
he left the table. Once during the conversation he had
sought to summon courage to confess about remaining
out of school that day, but the talk flowed on and his
resolution weakened. The opportunity passed; after that
he could not bring himself to bluntly declare the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, he&#8217;ll find out about it soon enough,&#8221; thought
the miserable lad. &#8220;Sterndale will come round and give
the whole thing away.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the evening passed on and Sterndale did not appear.
In his room, after darkness had fallen, Don tried
to read; but he found Henty dull, Optic tame, Alger insipid,
and not even that master of all writers for youth,
Trowbridge, could hold his attention and chain his restless
mind.</p>

<p>At last he heard a sound that caused him to start up.
It was a soft, peculiar whistle beneath his window, and
he knew Bentley had arrived.</p>

<p>For some moments Don stood irresolute, then, as the
whistle was repeated, he slipped down the back stairs and
admitted Leon to the house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the visitor, bringing out cigarettes the
moment they were in Don&#8217;s room and the door was
closed, &#8220;you&#8217;re dead lucky, old man, and don&#8217;t you forget
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky?&#8221; sneered the doctor&#8217;s son, derisively. &#8220;Well,
I&#8217;d like to know how! I think I&#8217;m just about the unluckiest
fellow on the face of the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you know anything about it,&#8221; said
Leon, having struck a match and lighted a cigarette,
&#8220;but Sterndale&#8217;s wilted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wilted? In what way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s backed down; he ain&#8217;t going to tackle your old
man to make him pay for the football and suits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; gasped Don, in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got it straight from Chatterton. I can always pump
him. He says Sterndale talked it over with the fellows.
Most of them wanted to carry the thing through, but
Dick said no, and he agreed to pay the damage himself.
You know, he always has his own way, and so that settled
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don drew a deep breath and sat down, feeling that
some of the load had been lifted from his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a smoke,&#8221; invited Leon, grinning. &#8220;It will
soothe you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don took a cigarette and lighted it.</p>

<p>For a long time the boys sat and chatted in low tones.
Don told how his father fancied he was still on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
eleven, and how he had failed to confess about playing
hookey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;re going to keep the old man
from finding out you&#8217;re not on the eleven,&#8221; said Leon,
&#8220;but he needn&#8217;t know that you hooked away from school.
All you have to do is to get me some paper and a sample
of his writing. I&#8217;ll fix it. Just let me show you what I
can do. You don&#8217;t have to carry the excuse if you don&#8217;t
want to, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Don went softly down the carpeted front stairs,
discovered his father was not in his office, slipped in and
took an old letter and some paper from the open desk,
and scudded noiselessly back to the room where his
tempter was smoking his fifth cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this is all right,&#8221; chuckled Bentley, as he prepared
to write at Don&#8217;s desk. &#8220;You&#8217;ve brought some
of the doctor&#8217;s letter paper, with his name and office
hours printed at the top. Why, with that, and this letter
to copy from, I can write an excuse that would fool the
greatest handwriting expert in the country. I&#8217;ll have to
practice a little and get on to the style of your dad&#8217;s
chirography.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor&#8217;s son watched Leon imitating the formation
of the letters and the general style of Dr. Scott&#8217;s
handwriting, and then, after a while, saw the visitor
slowly and carefully write out on one of the sheets of
letter paper an excuse for Don&#8217;s absence from school
signing it with the doctor&#8217;s name.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>&#8220;There,&#8221; said the youthful rascal, surveying with great
pride his handiwork. &#8220;I rather think that will do. Bad
headache, stomach out of order, feverish symptoms,
thought it best to let you remain away from school.
Isn&#8217;t that a bird, old man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very clever,&#8221; admitted Don, &#8220;but you had better
take care what you do in this line. Your skill in imitating
the writing of other persons may get you into
trouble some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out! I&#8217;m not a fool! Take that to old Alden to-morrow,
and he&#8217;ll accept it without a word. That&#8217;ll
keep your old gent from finding out anything now, and
something may prevent him from taking in any of the
games, so he won&#8217;t know you&#8217;re not on the eleven. It&#8217;s
best not to hurt his feelings by telling him everything.
I reckon I&#8217;d better be skipping out.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Leon was gone, Don picked up the forged excuse
and looked it over critically.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would fool me, that&#8217;s certain,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;The
imitation of father&#8217;s writing is perfect. But I can&#8217;t
carry this to Professor Alden.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took hold of it, as if intending to tear it up, but
hesitated, paused, wavered, then laid it down on the desk.</p>

<p>The following day, he took it to school and gave it to
the professor.</p>

<small>THE TACKLING MACHINE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Even without a football, Renwood succeeded in getting
some profitable practice out of the eleven. Early on
Monday morning he went to a certain carpenter&#8217;s shop
in the village and placed before the proprietor the plan of
a somewhat novel arrangement, consisting of two upright
timbers, with guy-ropes and pullies and running
lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather out of my line to make anything of the
sort,&#8221; said the carpenter; &#8220;but I guess I can do it if I
can git Enos Berry, the sail-maker, to help me. He
knows more about splicin&#8217; ropes and riggin&#8217; up tackle
than anybody round here. If I had anything else to do,
I wouldn&#8217;t touch it, but I&#8217;ll see what can be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want it all done by to-night,&#8221; said Dolph. &#8220;We
must have it to-night, and it must be set up on the field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t agree to have anything to do with your
dummy and weight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have those over home, and I&#8217;ll send for father to
have them brought here. I&#8217;ll come in at noon and see
how you&#8217;re getting along. By that time I ought to be
able to show you just how to fix it so it will work.&#8221;</p>

<p>At noon he visited the shop and found the two men
had progressed in a most satisfactory way with the work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
although they were a trifle foggy in regard to the manner
in which the machine was operated. Dolph carefully and
fully explained this to them, and gave them some final
instructions, departing in high spirits.</p>

<p>But, to his disappointment, when school was over that
afternoon, instead of finding the arrangement set up on
the football field, as he had hoped it would be, it was not
completed, another complication having arisen. So Renwood
was not on hand when the boys gathered after
supper for such practice as they could obtain without a
ball, and Sterndale was obliged to do what he could
unaided by the coach. This sort of work was very unsatisfactory,
and after a time the boys gave it up and
left the field, all of them wondering what had become of
Dolph.</p>

<p>The field had not been deserted long when Renwood
appeared upon it, accompanied by the men he had employed,
and there they labored till nearly dark.</p>

<p>Almost all the members of the eleven were in the club-rooms
when Renwood appeared there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, fellows!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I have something to
show you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; demanded several.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked others.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll all find out if you follow me,&#8221; answered the
coach, mysteriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it fur?&#8221; yawned Thad Boland, wearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t fur that I&#8217;m going to show you,&#8221; laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
Renwood. &#8220;What are you looking for&mdash;a bearskin
coat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean is it fur off,&#8221; explained Old Lightning.
&#8220;&#8217;Cause I&#8217;m too tired to walk fur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re alwus tired,&#8221; asserted Jotham Sprout. &#8220;You
was born that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to be funny, Bubble,&#8221; advised Thad; &#8220;for
when you try to be, you ain&#8217;t funny at all. Sometimes,
when you don&#8217;t mean to be, you&#8217;re really funny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, are you coming?&#8221; demanded Renwood. &#8220;If
you want to see it to-night you&#8217;ll have to hustle, or it
will be too dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; was again asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something worth seeing,&#8221; was his mysterious assertion,
which aroused their curiosity, and he soon had them
following him down the stairs, even Old Lightning lumbering
along grumblingly and wearily in the rear.</p>

<p>Straight to the field he led them, persistently refusing
to enlighten them on the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find out what it is when you see it,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>On the way they picked up Danny Chatterton, who
had been talking with Leon Bentley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bent is sore as bub-bub-blazes,&#8221; declared Danny.
&#8220;He says Sus-Sterndale&#8217;s gettin&#8217; to be an old wo-woman,
for he lets somebub-bub-body else ru-run the eleven and
ch-changes his mind about mum-making Scott&#8217;s father
pup-pup-pup-pay for the fuf-football and suits. He sus-says
he&#8217;d ha-ha-had to pay if he&#8217;d done it, and he thinks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
Sus-Sterndale ought to bub-bub-back up his threat to
gug-go to Scott&#8217;s fuf-father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have too much to say to that fellow, Chat,&#8221;
advised Dick. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be just as well off if you keep
away from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the football field was reached, Renwood led
them through the gate. It was already quite dark, and
rapidly getting darker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there!&#8221; he said, with an outward fling of his
arm.</p>

<p>They looked, and what they saw caused some of them
to utter exclamations of astonishment, not unmingled
with alarm. Before their eyes, dimly seen through the
gloom, something dangled in the air. And that something
very much resembled a human being, hung by the
neck, with its feet lifted just clear of the ground!</p>

<p>&#8220;Jupiter!&#8221; exclaimed Rob Linton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pwhat is it, Oi dunno?&#8221; gasped Dennis Murphy.</p>

<p>&#8220;A mum-mum-mum-man!&#8221; fluttered Chatterton.
&#8220;Hu-hung up by the nun-neck! Oh, gug-ginger!&#8221; His
teeth began to chatter and he backed away.</p>

<p>&#8220;It does look like a man,&#8221; admitted Water Mayfair.</p>

<p>Renwood burst out laughing, then suddenly ran forward,
flung himself at the dangling object, clutched it
with his arms and came down to the ground with it immediately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fair tackle!&#8221; laughed Sterndale. &#8220;Boys, I know what
it is. I&#8217;ve heard of them. It&#8217;s a tackling machine.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;ve hit it,&#8221; acknowledged Renwood, getting up,
whereupon the human-looking object that he had
dragged down rose like a thing of life and once more
dangled upright in the air, bobbing slightly, as if dancing
on nothing. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had this put up so that I may teach
you fellows how to tackle correctly without getting you
all bruised and battered and sore in the last few days
before the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi breathe again!&#8221; murmured Murphy, in great relief.
&#8220;Oi wur about to take to me heels an&#8217; run fer it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Run for it!&#8221; gurgled Jotham Sprout. &#8220;By smoke! I
was just getting ready to run the other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys went forward and examined the tackling
machine with great interest. They found two upright
timbers had been erected about twenty feet apart, being
connected by a strong rope from the top of one timber
to the top of the other, and held in place by guy-ropes
attached to stout pins that were driven into the ground.
On the connecting rope ran a pulley-truck with an iron
hook that held another and smaller block-pulley, through
which passed the rope that suspended at one end the
dummy to be tackled and at the other end the weight
that lifted the dummy clear of the ground. This weight
was arranged to drop just low enough to lift the dummy
to the proper distance and then stop. When the dummy
was tackled and brought down, the weight went up, the
rope running through the lower and smaller block. To
the upper block a second rope was made fast, running to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
small pulleys attached to the upright timbers a few
inches from the top, so that by pulling on either end of
this rope the dummy could be set in motion, drawn
along swiftly, stopped suddenly, and caused to retreat in
opposite direction. The dummy was a stout, heavy
figure, made to represent a man dressed in a padded football
suit, but having neither arms nor feet.</p>

<p>All this was very interesting, and the boys poured out
their questions in single shots, scattering fires and volleys,
so that it was not possible for Dolph to immediately
answer them; but he explained that the dummy
was one he had brought with him from Boston, having
been purchased for him by his father, and the machine
in a general way resembled the one invented by Captain
Garret Cochran, of the Princeton University Football
Team.</p>

<p>Then they were eager to try it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clear the road!&#8221; bellowed Jotham Sprout, bracing
himself at a distance of about twenty feet and pulling
his cap down over his fat head. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to show ye
how to tackle the old thing. Just watch me do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Renwood immediately caught hold of one end of the
rope that drew the dummy along, while the boys stood
aside to witness the fat lad&#8217;s tackle. Jotham charged
furiously and flung himself at the dummy with outstretched
arms, but Dolph gave a sharp pull on the rope,
and the figure moved aside, so that Sprout clutched
nothing but empty air, and crashed to the ground like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
fallen elephant, his breath being driven from his body in
a great grunt of astonishment.</p>

<p>The boys shouted with laughter, while Jotham sat up
and stared in disgust at the swaying dummy, wheezing:</p>

<p>&#8220;The blamed thing dodged!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Bubble!&#8221; shouted Mayfair. &#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder you
didn&#8217;t burst when you struck the ground. Ha! ha! ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He! he! he!&#8221; mocked Jotham, sourly. &#8220;What made
the hanged old thing do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s for,&#8221; asserted Renwood. &#8220;What
would it be good for if it always hung still and let you
tackle? A running man will dodge you if he can, and
the dummy is made to do the same thing. That is so
you&#8217;ll tackle quick and sure, and be on the watch for any
move the other fellow may try to make.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it wasn&#8217;t fair that time, for I warn&#8217;t ready for
it to jump like that,&#8221; said Bubble, heavily rising to his
feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try it again,&#8221; urged several.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me!&#8221; Jotham protested. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll look on
and see some of the rest of ye try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurroo!&#8221; cried Dennis Murphy, prancing off and
spitting on his hands. &#8220;Oi&#8217;ll be afther havin&#8217; a go at it,
an&#8217; let&#8217;s see thot bag av sawdust dodge me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Renwood. &#8220;Go ahead, Murphy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dennis made a dash at the dummy, expecting Dolph
would give it another pull in the same direction as before,
but Sterndale had slipped up and taken hold of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
other end of the rope, and, at the critical moment, the
figure seemed to spring the other way. The result was
that the Irish youth miscalculated entirely and went
down, but he came up from the ground as if he had
been thrown erect by springs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Howld on!&#8221; he ejaculated, whirling about and glaring
at the object, while the amused lads shouted again.
&#8220;Is it backward ye dodge, Oi dunno? Sure, ye&#8217;re a
shlick crayther, av Oi ivver saw wan, but Oi&#8217;ll down yez
av it takes me all noight, so Ol will.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang at the dummy again, caught it waist high,
and brought it down immediately.</p>

<p>After this the boys took turns at it, having it drawn
swiftly along and running at an angle to head it off, pursuing
it, meeting it, and coming at it in various ways.
Dolph showed them just how to tackle low and effectively,
and they would not stop till it was too dark for
them to practice on the machine with any success.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let every fellow get up here by seven o&#8217;clock to-morrow
morning,&#8221; said Sterndale, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll put in an
hour on this machine. We ought to get our new ball
by to-morrow night, and so we&#8217;re not going to be hurt
much, as far as practice is concerned, by the destruction
of the other one.&#8221;</p>

<p>In high spirits, they left the field, laughing, joking
and singing, and the sentiment universally expressed was
that a fellow who took so much trouble and interest in
coaching them was the right person for the position.</p>

<small>TROUBLE ON THE TEAM.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I did not see you practicing after school to-night with
the other boys, Don,&#8221; said Dr. Scott, two evenings later.
&#8220;I happened to be driving past the ground, and so I
stopped at the gate and looked on a few moments. I expected
to see you in the midst of it. Where were you,
my son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I was not feeling very well,&#8221; declared Don, as
smoothly as he could, although he knew his face had
flushed, &#8220;and so I did not practice to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; exclaimed his aunt; &#8220;what did I tell you,
Lyman! I knew there was something the matter with
him, as he hasn&#8217;t been acting at all natural for the past
few days. I&#8217;m afraid, brother, you will have cause to
regret permitting him to indulge indiscriminately in that
rough and dangerous game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly think there is any cause for alarm,&#8221; smiled
the doctor. &#8220;Any boy may have a turn at feeling indisposed
in the midst of apple-time, when every orchard is
inviting him to gorge himself. You have not been hurt
in practice, have you, Don?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, sir! not at all,&#8221; was the hasty answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re feeling all right now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>&#8220;Let me look at your tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don shamefacedly showed his tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slight coat on it,&#8221; commented his father. &#8220;Stomach
a trifle disturbed. I&#8217;ll give you something for that before
you go to bed. You&#8217;ll be all right in the morning.
It wouldn&#8217;t do for you to fall ill now, with the great
game against Highland only four days ahead, would it,
my boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; said Don, intensely disgusted with himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see, what position are you to play?&#8221; asked
the doctor, pursuing the conversation, to the boy&#8217;s increasing
discomfiture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Half-back,&#8221; answered Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must have considerable running and kicking
to do, for I believe that is one of the most important
positions on the team. They must think pretty well of
you, Don, to give you such a prominent place on the
eleven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, they think well of me!&#8221; murmured the uneasy
youth, with hidden bitterness.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is the team coming on in a general way?&#8221; persisted
the man. &#8220;Do you think it is improving with practice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you do not speak in a confident manner. You
how, those Highlanders make a hard crowd to beat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume this young Renwood, who is instructing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
the team, knows all about the game?&#8221; said the doctor,
causing his son to writhe inwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He thinks he does,&#8221; laughed Don, shortly and
harshly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he has played it some, and so he must be able
to give you many valuable points. Is he an agreeable
sort of fellow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Don, speaking the truth this time, at
least; &#8220;I do not like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s unpleasant,&#8221; said Dr. Scott, noting with regret
the dark look on the boy&#8217;s face, &#8220;but you must not
permit that to keep you from doing your level best in
practice and in the game. At times it is necessary for
us to put aside all personal likes and dislikes and join
heartily with friends or foes in working together for a
result. The boy who permits his personal feelings to
rule his conduct in baseball or football will never make
the highest type of player, and there is danger that he
will not be very successful when he leaves school and
enters on a business or professional career, for he will be
ruled by prejudices and likings and not by sound common
sense and reason. My boy, I want you to promise
me that, for all you may dislike one or more of your
associates on the eleven, you will join with the others in
doing your level best under every condition to win from
your opponents. Promise me this, Don.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>The youth choked a little and turned his eyes away. It
was too late now, he fancied, to reveal to his father the
exact condition of affairs, and so the deception must be
continued at any cost of torture to his outraged conscience.
Far better would it have been had he nerved
himself to speak the truth without further subterfuge
and falsehood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you are the kind of a boy to think first of
winning, regardless of your personal feelings,&#8221; asserted
the doctor, not, however, without a shade of anxiety in
his voice. &#8220;That being the case, it is your express duty
to do everything you can honestly and squarely do to
assist toward the desired result, even though it is necessary
to sacrifice yourself in order to aid an enemy on
your own side to make a successful play. I want you to
promise that you will do so if the occasion arises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; thought Don, &#8220;for I shall not play, and
so the occasion will not arise.&#8221; And he gave the desired
promise.</p>

<p>He took the medicine which his father gave him, as
he could not easily avoid doing so, and then retired to
his own room, relieved and thankful to escape. In the
seclusion of his room, he seemed to turn in anger and
disgust on himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re a pretty cheap creature, Don Scott!&#8221; he
muttered, fiercely. &#8220;You&#8217;re getting to be a slick liar!
How long will you be able to keep it up? What will he
think of you when he finds out the whole truth?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>The following night, he remained away from home
during the time the eleven was practicing on the field,
being forced to accept Bentley for a companion. But
Don found that by association he was learning to tolerate
Leon far easier than at first, for all that some traits
and actions of the fellow still jarred on his nerves. Misery
loves company, it is said, and both boys had once
been members of the eleven, so they sought a secluded
spot where they could smoke and talk and pass the time
away till Don dared venture home.</p>

<p>Scott did not stop at one cigarette now; he smoked
three, and would have smoked more but that a certain
unpleasant sensation warned him to desist.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking to &#8217;em as a duck takes to water,&#8221; declared
Leon, encouragingly. &#8220;I rather guess you&#8217;ve
found they&#8217;re good for what ails yer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they give a fellow something to do to pass away
the time,&#8221; said Don; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t care about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will some time,&#8221; averred the other. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
want them with you all the time. But, say, they ain&#8217;t
having such a slick old time since you and I left the
eleven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Don, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re not getting along as well as they might.
They&#8217;ve put Smith in your place and Linton in mine,
with Boland as right tackle. Murphy couldn&#8217;t get along
with Old Lightning near him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I thought Carter was going to take your place.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>&#8220;They found it wouldn&#8217;t work, for Old Lightning was
too slow for end work. Carter is filling Smith&#8217;s place
on the end, but Renwood kicks like a steer about Boland.
Thad is getting sick of it, too, and it wouldn&#8217;t surprise
me a bit if he got out. Anyhow, all these changes have
made the right wing of the line awfully weak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Boland gets out, they&#8217;re up a tree!&#8221; exclaimed Don,
with a feeling of unjust triumph. &#8220;They haven&#8217;t a
good substitute now, and it will break them all up to
lose Thad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; cried Bentley, gleefully. &#8220;They will
be in the soup! What will they do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it up. What could they do now if a man should
be hurt in a game?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve been talking of taking one of the mill fellows
along as a substitute, but they don&#8217;t like to do it.
There are a dozen fellows who go to the academy and
who might play, but they won&#8217;t have anything to do
with the game. They&#8217;ve got a scrub team from Lobsterville
playing with them for practice to-night. Perhaps
they&#8217;ll get somebody out of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps so, but I doubt it. Sterndale can blame himself
for letting Renwood boss things, if they do happen
to get into a box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing is certain,&#8221; said Leon, wagging his head;
&#8220;they won&#8217;t get us to help them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t likely they&#8217;ll want us,&#8221; muttered Don, bitterly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>And so they passed the time in talking of these things
till the doctor&#8217;s son dared venture homeward. On his
way, he dropped into a tobacco store and, in a very self-conscious,
guilty manner, bought a package of cigarettes,
which he slipped into an inner pocket.</p>

<p>Bentley had spoken the truth in saying the eleven was
not progressing in a satisfactory manner. Renwood had
worked hard to teach them, and they had received instructions
in punting, drop-kicking, place-kicking, passing,
tackling and interference; but when it came to working
out the various plays, Thad Boland could not be
aroused to the absolute necessity of quick and decisive
action, and he bothered and hindered the others in a
provoking manner. Thad was large enough and heavy
enough to become a good man in the line, but it seemed
doubtful if he would get into action and make himself of
the least consequence in the game. Renwood scolded
him and Sterndale coaxed him, but neither scolding nor
soft words brought the desired result.</p>

<p>That night in the game against the scrub team, which
was made up of all sorts and conditions of boys, there
being sixteen in all, instead of eleven, Thad utterly refused
to earnestly exert himself, declaring it was no use
to &#8220;slash and tear &#8217;round&#8221; in a fooling game of that sort,
nor could any kind of talk or influence affect him. As
the regulars failed to make an entirely satisfactory showing
against the scrub, this was most annoying and not a
little disheartening.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>After the game, Sterndale, Renwood, Smith and Murphy
drew aside to talk matters over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we gave the scrub the advantage of numbers
and the wind,&#8221; said the coach, somewhat ruefully;
&#8220;but that is no excuse for our failure to score oftener.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The right end of the line is terribly weak,&#8221; confessed
Sterndale, who looked troubled. &#8220;Carter is a new man
on the end, Boland is too lazy at tackle, and Sprout is too
fat as guard. We must make a change, Renwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty late in the day to make a change now, but
we may have to do it. The team was far better as it
stood originally, with Smith on the end and Linton next
to him; but you had to pull Smith back to half to fill
Scott&#8217;s place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I don&#8217;t fill it,&#8221; said the tall boy; &#8220;but you
bet I&#8217;ll do my level best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right, John,&#8221; declared the captain of the
eleven, laying an arm across Smith&#8217;s shoulders with
something like affectionate familiarity. &#8220;You&#8217;re just as
good a man as Scott was at half, but it has weakened the
line taking you off the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this was the same John Smith who had once
been called the hoodoo of the baseball nine, derisively
nicknamed &#8220;Jonah,&#8221; and treated with inconsideration or
positive contempt by Richard Sterndale. Having proved
his worth, he was now held in esteem by the very ones
who had entertained nothing but scorn for him, and no
more was the opprobrious nickname applied to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Dennis Murphy beamed with satisfaction and pleasure.
In the days of Smith&#8217;s disgrace the Irish lad had been
the only one of the village boys to side with him and
stand by him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thot b&#8217;y&#8217;s all roight wheriver ye put him, Misthur
Sterndale,&#8221; he declared, loyally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Smith&#8217;s all right,&#8221; agreed Dolph, promptly; &#8220;but
we weakened the line by taking him off. If the Highlanders
ever discovered just how easy our right end is,
they could raise hob with us by hammering at it all the
time&mdash;and they will discover it, sure as fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Renwood appeared worried, and his manner impressed
the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; asked the captain. &#8220;What would
you advise, Dolph?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bentley is a better man than Boland, if he will do
his best. If we could get him back into his old position
as left tackle and put Linton into Boland&#8217;s place, it would
strengthen the right end some.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sterndale nodded. &#8220;Bentley is not a first-class man,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but he would be an improvement on Boland.
Then, if we could put Smith on the end again, with Carter
in Bubble&#8217;s position, we&#8217;d be all right as far as the
line is concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But without a right half,&#8221; said Renwood. &#8220;Now, if
Scott&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use to talk of him!&#8221; exclaimed Dick, quickly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
&#8220;We don&#8217;t want that kind of a fellow on the team. Isn&#8217;t
that your opinion, Dolph?&#8221;</p>

<p>Renwood did not answer at once. He was aware that
the others were watching him closely and waiting with interest
for him to express himself on that point. At last,
he slowly said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be better to play with almost anybody than
to be badly beaten just because there was one weak point
in the team, you know. If Scott didn&#8217;t have such a beastly
temper&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the worst thing,&#8221; the captain grimly asserted.
&#8220;A fellow who will do what he did is too nasty
to be on the team. And you seem to forget that he tried
to lay it on to you, Dolph.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t forget; but I was thinking of the eleven,
not of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re altogether too generous, old man. But we
won&#8217;t talk about Scott; he&#8217;s out of the question. However,
I&#8217;ll see Bentley and tell him he can come back into
his old place. That will set Linton over to right tackle,
which will strengthen that end of the line some. If it
had not been for Dummy and Murphy, who could not
get along with Boland, I should not have shifted Linton
into Bentley&#8217;s place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure Leon will come back?&#8221; asked John
Smith. &#8220;You know he&#8217;s friendly with Scott now, and
he&#8217;s been saying all kinds of hard things about you and
the rest of us. Won&#8217;t he stick by Scott?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>&#8220;Stick by nothing!&#8221; exclaimed Dick, with a laugh.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll get him back on to the team easy enough. He isn&#8217;t
the kind of a chap to stick by anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d think more of him if he was,&#8221; declared Renwood;
&#8220;but I guess it&#8217;s the best you can do, Captain Sterndale.
Better get him back in a hurry, if you&#8217;re going to get him
at all, so he will have the advantage of what little practice
we get before Saturday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have him up here for practice to-morrow morning,&#8221;
promised Dick, confidently.</p>

<p>And he kept his word.</p>

<small>THE NET OF DECEPTION.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Bentley, I want to see you,&#8221; called Don
Scott, sharply, as Leon was hurrying homeward from
school the following noon.</p>

<p>Leon cast a backward glance over the shoulder and
saw the doctor&#8217;s son coming after him with swinging
strides. The day was dark and lowering and a storm
was threatening, but Bentley saw indications of a swifter
and more violent storm in the face of the boy who was
hastened to overtake him, which made him feel like taking
to his heels and seeking shelter from the outbreak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a hurry,&#8221; he cried, half pausing and then quickening
his steps once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t bother you long,&#8221; was the assertion which
failed to reassure him in the slightest degree. &#8220;What I
have to say to you I can say in short order. Hold on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t dare to touch me,&#8221; thought Leon, seeking
to quiet his own fears, but not entirely succeeding. &#8220;I
might as well let him blaze away and have it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused at a street corner and waited. A wet wind
was slashing viciously at the trees that lined the street,
and a yellow leaf, harbinger of the great flocks to follow,
came fluttering like a wounded bird to Bentley&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>The pursuer came up with a few swift, firm steps and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
stopped, regarding Leon with scorn and anger apparently
unspeakable, so that the vacillating fellow stared at the
ground and weakly asked, forcing himself with a painful
effort to utter the words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a nice one, you are!&#8221; grated Don, with a motion
that caused the other to start back a bit and lift one
hand, like an oft-beaten child who expects a blow. &#8220;Oh,
I&#8217;m not going to touch you, so don&#8217;t cringe like a
whipped cur!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; Bentley snapped, trying
to stiffen up and put on a bold front. &#8220;If you have
anything to say to me, why don&#8217;t you say it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will. You&#8217;re a treacherous sneak! You&#8217;re a two-faced
whelp! That ought to be plain enough for you to
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come, Scott!&#8221; exclaimed Leon, changing his
manner. &#8220;What reason have you got to make such talk
to me? What have I done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what you&#8217;ve done! You pretended to be
my friend, and yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am your friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re nothing of the sort! I wouldn&#8217;t own you for
a friend! You have gone back on me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I know what you&#8217;re driving at. You&#8217;re
mad because I&#8217;ve gone back onto the eleven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After swearing over and over that you&#8217;d stick to me
through thick and thin! After vowing you&#8217;d never play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
on the team unless I did! I didn&#8217;t ask for all those promises,
but you made them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I meant to keep them when I made them, Scott&mdash;&mdash;honest
I did. But Sterndale came and offered me
my old position, and so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You went back on your word and quit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve not quit you; I&#8217;m still your friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; cried Don, scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am!&#8221; palpitated Leon, eager to convince his companion.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll prove it to you, too. You don&#8217;t think I
went back because I want to help them win, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor&#8217;s son did not speak, and Bentley hastened
to go on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on your life! That wasn&#8217;t my little game. I
went back because I can keep track of things better by
standing in with the gang. I can watch Dolph Renwood,
and I may get a good chance to give him a dig that will
do him up. Can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m liable to get a better
chance at him now? I haven&#8217;t forgotten that he got
Sterndale to drop me, and I&#8217;ll pay him back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a case of treachery on one side or the other,&#8221; declared
Don. &#8220;If you&#8217;re not lying to me, you&#8217;ve gone
back to betray the team, and so you&#8217;re a sneak, just the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you beat anything!&#8221; gasped Leon, quite unable
to understand the other youth. &#8220;You want to see them
get it in the neck because Renwood is coaching them,
and yet you turn up your nose at me when you think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
there is a chance that I may be able to give them the
throw-down. What are you made of, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I&#8217;m made of different stuff than you are. I do
want them to be beaten, but I&#8217;m not on the eleven. If I
were on it, no matter how I felt, I&#8217;d have to do my best
to help win. If you do anything else, you will be a
traitor and a sneak.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some color mounted to Bentley&#8217;s thin cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the funniest fellow on legs!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Of course I wouldn&#8217;t do anything to down the team
unless I could throw it all on Renwood&#8217;s shoulders. I&#8217;m
keeping my eyes open for a chance to show him up dirty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don was silent a moment, looking squarely at Leon
with those dark, piercing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thad Boland may be lazy,&#8221; he finally said; &#8220;but a
lazy man is better than a sneak and a traitor. Sterndale
made a mistake when he took you back, and I&#8217;d tell him
so if I thought he&#8217;d pay any attention to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be sorry some time for this kind of talk,
Scott!&#8221; snapped Leon, in bewildered anger. &#8220;There
come some girls, and I don&#8217;t want to talk with you any
longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don saw several girls coming down the street, Dora
Deland and Zadia Renwood among them, and he immediately
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t want to be seen talking with you, nor
do I want anything further to do with you. You can
keep away from me in the future. Understand?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>Without waiting for Leon to answer, he hastened onward
toward home, leaving Bentley to wait for the girls
and force himself upon them as a companion and escort,
whether he was wanted or not.</p>

<p>That afternoon it rained. Don sat at his desk and listened
to the dash of the wind-driven cloud-tears against
a near-by window. Sometimes he studied, but oftener
he was thinking of things far removed from books and
recitations. The rain had begun late in the day and was
pretty certain to continue, so there could be no practice
for the Rockspur Eleven that night.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve made another shift about since taking Bentley
back,&#8221; thought Don, &#8220;and every change disturbs them
some. There&#8217;s little time now for them to get used to
the new line-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not necessary for him to remain away from
home on the pretense of practicing that night, which
gave him no small satisfaction. He passed the evening
reading.</p>

<p>The following day was bright and clear, and the eleven
turned out for morning practice on the field. At school
Don fancied the members of the team showed something
like satisfaction, as if things had moved better. Even
Thad Boland seemed relieved and well pleased.</p>

<p>Saturday came, and as Don came down in the morning,
he was greeted by his father, who cheerfully cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a fine day for the great game, my son&mdash;bright,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
sunny and cool. Are you feeling in first-class trim for
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am feeling first rate,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good; but it seems to me that you are not
looking as well as usual. Perhaps regular practice, together
with your studies, has taken hold of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, not at all,&#8221; the boy hastened to declare. &#8220;I&#8217;m
feeling fine as a fiddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad of that, for you have a hard task before
you to beat Highland on its own ground. I suppose
you&#8217;ll want an early dinner to-day, as you always start
away by noon when you are going to Highland?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; half-past eleven will be about right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did think of driving over to Highland this afternoon
and taking a look at the game,&#8221; said the doctor, causing
Don&#8217;s heart to stop beating for a moment; &#8220;but I find I
shall be unable to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy breathed again, inwardly thanking fortune.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to do your best to-day, my son,&#8221; pursued
his father; &#8220;and remember to guard your temper and
keep your head cool. Promise me that you will not,
under any provocation, permit your temper to master you
to-day, Don.&#8221;</p>

<p>The promise was given, and they sat down to breakfast,
during which, to the continued uneasiness of the
youth, Dr. Scott persisted in talking about football and
asking unpleasant questions. Don was glad enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
escape from the house under pretense of going to the
field to put in some morning practice.</p>

<p>To him it now seemed necessary to continue the deception
as long as he could, and it is even probable that
he hoped his father might never find out the truth, although
this hardly appeared possible. In the beginning,
the deception had seemed a small matter and of little
consequence, but, having taken the first false step, he had
been led on till now the burden of the deceit seemed more
than he could bear. It was wearing on his nerves and
blunting all his finer instincts of honor, for Don was
naturally an upright and straightforward youth, who,
despite his violent disposition, detested anything dishonorable.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that he remained away from home
all the forenoon, shunning and avoiding the other village
boys, who shunned and avoided him. When he came
rushing home, it was at the last minute, apparently, as if
the exciting events of the day had caught and carried
him away in their clutches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Land of goodness!&#8221; cried his aunt, as he flung himself
down at the table. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tear the house to pieces!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a hurry,&#8221; he declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you wait for your pa? The tea ain&#8217;t quite
ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait for anything, and I don&#8217;t want any tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must eat a good hearty dinner, for you&#8217;ll
need it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>&#8220;Strictly against orders,&#8221; he declared, helping himself
to the mashed potatoes and cold corned beef. &#8220;No man
is permitted to overload his stomach on the day of a
game.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fell to eating without ceremony and was quite finished
when his father came in at the ringing of the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! hello!&#8221; exclaimed the doctor. &#8220;Have you
eaten? Why, you haven&#8217;t been in the house five minutes.
I heard you when you came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to excuse me, father; I didn&#8217;t have time
to wait for you. I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on! Aren&#8217;t you going to take your overcoat?
It will be chilly riding home to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came near forgetting it,&#8221; said Don, whose great
anxiety was to get out of the house before his father
could ask any more questions. &#8220;Good-by, Aunt Ella.&#8221;
He kissed her and then dashed up the stairs, leaving her
standing by the table, with uplifted hands, while the doctor
sat down, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless us! bless us!&#8221; breathed the good woman.
&#8220;What are boys in these days coming to? They actually
go crazy over baseball, football and such things. Now,
in our day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys played barn tag, three-old-cat, prisoner&#8217;s base
and games of that class; now they have something better,
sister. There is more sense in baseball, football, tennis,
polo, basket-ball and other modern games.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there may be,&#8221; sighed Aunt Ella, sitting down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
and preparing to pour the tea; &#8220;but I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s more
danger, and Don gets so crazy over them that I expect
he&#8217;ll come home dead some day, or crippled for life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don was heard coming swiftly downstairs, taking
three at a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck, my boy,&#8221; called the doctor. &#8220;Remember
my advice. Take care of yourself, and do your level best
to help Rockspur win.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door slammed and Don was gone, but not to play
football.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.<br />


<small>WHILE THE GAME WAS PLAYED.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>On a jutting ledge far up the side of Ragged Mountain,
where he could overlook the village, harbor, open
sea and hilly country to the westward, a lonely boy sat
astride a spur of the blue rock, gazing downward at a
dark object crawling steadily along the brown thread of
a road which led from the village, crooked about the shores
of the amethyst lake and wound into the distance that
swallowed it from sight.</p>

<p>The boy was Don Scott, who had made feverish haste
to get out of Rockspur ahead of the football team, leaving
his overcoat at the little railroad station which he
passed on the Lobsterville side. From the station he had
followed the railroad to the foot of the mountain, where
he found a dimly-defined path that led him, panting and
toiling, upward to the ledge on which he was now
perched.</p>

<p>At his feet lay Lake Glenwood, seeming near enough
for him to hurl a pebble into it with no great effort, although
he knew it was quite half-a-mile from the foot of
the mountain. His eyes had hastily followed the road
along the shore till they found, far beyond the middle
section of the lake and pursuing the stream that led off
from it, the dark object which he knew was the big buckboard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
carrying the members of the Rockspur Eleven to
Highland.</p>

<p>&#8220;There they go!&#8221; he panted. &#8220;Renwood is with them!
Bentley is with them! and I am here!&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed bitterly, and then became silent as the wind
seemed to bring faintly to his ears the refrain of a familiar
song often sung by the boys on their way to a
game or returning from a victorious contest. He could
not distinguish the words, but the indistinct sound of the
chorus, like a momentary murmur of the wind, was
enough to cause those words to flash across his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Singing!&#8221; he cried, fiercely &#8220;Don&#8217;t be so sure you&#8217;ll
&#8216;win to-day.&#8217; You can&#8217;t tell. Anyhow, I hope you won&#8217;t!
I hope you&#8217;ll be beaten out of your boots!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat there and watched till the buckboard disappeared
along with the brown road that had run to a
hiding place amid the woods and hills. Even then he did
not stir, but long after that he remained on the ledge, yet
without deriving any pleasure from the beauty of the
scene spread out before him in all the enchanting colors
which a river-threaded, lake-dotted, sea-edged landscape
reveals beneath the midday sun of early autumn.</p>

<p>At last he left the ledge and came slowly down the
mountain. He did not follow the path all the way to the
foot of the descent, but turned to the left, skirting the
base of Round Stone Cliff, where pleasure-seekers had
sent great stones shooting and bounding down the face
of the steep declivity, thundering over the lower slope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
and crashing into the tangled thickets below, tearing
crooked paths through the woods to the point where they
were piled in confusion into a deep, dark ravine.</p>

<p>What if some unseen person, knowing nothing of his
presence below, were to start a huge bowlder rolling
from the top of the cliff as he made his way along its
base! He thought of that and laughed!</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em come!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I can dodge &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing of the kind happened, however, which, without
doubt, for all of his confidence in his dodging ability,
was fortunate for him.</p>

<p>Beyond the cliff, after forcing his way through dense
and matted thickets, he came out into the Boxberry Pasture,
as it was called by the boys. This was an elevated
spot, where he could still look down on the harbor and
village. The pasture was a mass of stumps and rocks
and knolls, the latter being covered with interwoven
vines, which gave to his nostrils the smell of dried checkerberry,
plumes of which showed here and there in bright
red patches.</p>

<p>Crossing the pasture, he descended to the road that led
away to the Powder Mill Woods, where he felt that he
might be alone for the afternoon. He hoped that he
would not meet on the road any one who knew him, and,
to his satisfaction and relief, he did not.</p>

<p>The woods seemed dark and still when he first entered
them, and a feeling of loneliness beset him; yet there
was a subtle something about the peaceful stillness that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
soothed his troubled spirit with a gentle suggestion of
sadness that, strangely enough, gave him a sensation of
enjoyment.</p>

<p>Beneath his feet, where the trees were thick overhead,
the ground was damp and yielding, giving his footfall
no sound, save when a twig snapped with a muffled noise.
The air that he breathed was sweet with the odor of pine
and balsam and damp earth. The sunshine did not
glare before his eyes, and the dense shadows added to
the tranquillity he sought.</p>

<p>So he wandered through the &#8220;dim aisles of the woods,&#8221;
and after a time he found they were not so lonely and deserted
as they appeared. He paused to watch a tiny
black-hooded chickadee that was doing all kinds of gymnastic
tricks upon a bush, clinging to the side of a branch
one moment, hanging upside down the next, and constantly
on the move, now and then gleefully crying:
&#8220;Chick-a-dee-dee-dee-dee.&#8221; He sat on a damp and rotting
log and observed a red-headed woodpecker rat-tat-tatting
away at the trunk of an old dead tree and saw a
squirrel skurrying along the ground. And the hours
slipped away with few disturbing thoughts of the football
game that was taking place in Highland.</p>

<p>When he was tired of wandering in the woods, he
sought the favorite spot by the Powder Mill Dam, where
he lay on the ground or sat on the rocks and watched a
speckled trout in a placid pool below the dam. So the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
afternoon passed, the sun dropped low, the shadows deepened
and night drew on.</p>

<p>In the dusk, he returned along the road that led toward
the village, the lights of which were beginning to gleam
through the gloom across the harbor. He did not wish
to appear in the village before the members of the eleven
returned from Highland, and he knew they could not get
back till some time after dark.</p>

<p>Reaching the Highland road, he paused a while, fully
satisfied that neither players nor spectators from Rockspur
had passed on the return journey. He sat on an old
stone wall and waited till two village boys on bicycles,
their lanterns making long white streaks of light on the
road before them, came along from the direction of
Highland. Although it was rather dark for him to make
out who they were by the aid of his eyes, he recognized
them by their voices, as they were talking about the
game while they sped swiftly past toward the crest of
Bloody Hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Skinny Jones and Pug Andrews,&#8221; muttered Don, rising
from the wall and making for the road. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
come in ahead of the others, for Skinny is a scorcher.
There&#8217;s time enough to get over the bridge before the
buckboard comes along.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, as he was hurrying down the hill, there was a rattle
of carriage wheels behind him. He looked back and
saw a team come over the crest of the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t the buckboard,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>But it proved to be a carriage driven by no less a person
than Dolph Renwood, who was accompanied by his
sister and Dora Deland. The light from a window of
the railroad station at the foot of the hill shone out and
fell full on Don, so those in the carriage recognized him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Scott!&#8221; cried a musical voice, &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry
we didn&#8217;t have you with us! If you had been there, I
truly believe we might have won the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the carriage clattered on, and Don turned in to
the station to get his overcoat. He knew now that Rockspur
had lost, but somehow Zadia&#8217;s words had seemed to
rob him of the satisfaction he had expected to feel over
such a result.</p>

<p>&#8220;She spoke to me!&#8221; he murmured; &#8220;she spoke to me,
for all that she was with him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Obtaining the overcoat, he hastened down through
Lobsterville to the bridge, crossed the river, turned to the
left and hurried past the post-office on the corner, then
made his way home by a back street.</p>

<p>Don dreaded to meet his father, for he knew Dr. Scott
would question him about the game. It was his intention
to make a pretense of being so disgusted over the
result of the game that he did not wish to say anything
about it; but he wondered what he could do in case his
father pinned him down to tell the exact score.</p>

<p>Fortunately, his father was not at home, as he found
after slipping quietly into the house, and he learned from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
his aunt that the doctor had been called to a neighboring
town to consult over a critical case.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said he might not get home before eight or nine
o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said the thoughtful old soul, who had supper
ready to put on the table. &#8220;I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;re awful hungry?
You didn&#8217;t get no legs nor arms broke to-day, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t get hurt at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fortunate&mdash;fortunate, indeed! I didn&#8217;t know but
you&#8217;d come home dead.&#8221; Then, after a pause, &#8220;I s&#8217;pose
you beat the Highlanders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; they beat us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare!&#8221; cried Aunt Ella, sympathetically, stopping
half way from the kitchen door to the dining-room table,
the teapot in one hand and a plate of warm rolls in the
other. &#8220;Now, that&#8217;s too bad! I&#8217;m real sorry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m real hungry. Just hustle on the grub, Aunt
Ella, and see me wreak havoc and destruction on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to feel half as bad about losing as I
thought you would,&#8221; said she, as she complied with his
request. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like you, for you used to feel awful cut
up when you got beat at baseball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, we&#8217;ll even this up with Highland all right
next game,&#8221; asserted Don, sitting down to the table.
&#8220;It&#8217;s no use crying over spilled milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never cry, but you do feel bad, and this is the
first time I ever saw you like this. I don&#8217;t understand
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don came near laughing aloud, but repressed the inclination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
with an effort. When he had satisfied his hunger
he went up to his room. He felt like going out to see
if he could not find somebody to give him the particulars
of the game, but his pride caused him to decide not to
pursue such a course, as he did not wish any of his former
companions to think he would take that much interest
in the affairs of the eleven.</p>

<p>Some boys in Don&#8217;s position would have sought the
defeated players for the purpose of jeering at them and
deriding them, and it must be confessed that Scott was
strongly tempted to do so; but he decided that it would
cut them far more if he made a pretension of absolute
and utter indifference, and in this he was right. A person
who can deport himself with an air of indifference and
unconcern toward those whom he dislikes has not only
won a victory over himself and his natural inclinations
to show scorn or hatred for his enemies, but he causes
those enemies to feel that he considers them of such small
consequence that he does not even take the trouble to
become annoyed or offended at them. In the long run,
indifference is a keener weapon than open scorn and
hatred.</p>

<p>So Don remained at home, seeking to pass the evening
as best he could. Wishing to do some writing, and finding
in his desk no pens to suit him, he went down into
his father&#8217;s office. Having lighted the hanging lamp, he
sat down at the doctor&#8217;s open desk, and there he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
writing busily some time later when a gentle tapping
sounded on the window near his elbow. Looking round,
he saw the outlines of a face close to the glass and recognized
Leon Bentley, who was peering in at him with a
smirking grin of conciliation and friendliness.</p>

<small>BENTLEY TELLS HOW IT HAPPENED.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Don&#8217;s first feeling was one of annoyance and anger,
and he was about to sharply command the fellow to go
away when he suddenly changed his mind.</p>

<p>Leon could tell him all about the game, and there was
nothing he then desired to know quite as much as the
full particulars of the contest that had resulted in a victory
for the Highlanders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let him in and find out all about it,&#8221; he decided,
as Bentley nodded and beckoned. Then he motioned for
the boy outside to come round to the front door, at which
he admitted him a few moments later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the old gent?&#8221; asked Leon, with an assumed
air of carelessness. &#8220;I was slipping round to throw
some pebbles up against your window, in which I saw a
light, when I happened to notice you in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father is out,&#8221; said Don, somewhat gruffly. &#8220;He
won&#8217;t be back before ten. Come into the office.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leon followed with a swaggering air, and Don closed
the door when they were in the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;So aunt won&#8217;t hear us talking,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;What
do you want, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I just came round to tell you,&#8221; chuckled Leon,
coolly appropriating the office chair in front of the desk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
where Don had been sitting. &#8220;It would have done you
good to see that game to-day. Oh, my! but it was a
slaughter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rockspur was beaten?&#8221; said Don, trying to repress a
show of eagerness and great interest, but betraying his
exultant satisfaction in his gleaming eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beaten! I should guess yes. Rockspur wasn&#8217;t in it
for a minute. It was a walk-over for Highland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the score?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty-three to nine. How does that suit you? Isn&#8217;t
that a beautiful record for Sterndale&#8217;s champs? Oh, but
Sterndale is sick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do?&#8221; demanded Scott, sharply. &#8220;Did
you do anything crooked to help lose the game?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t have to, my boy,&#8221; snickered Bentley. &#8220;It was
a cinch for Highland from the start, and you can bet I
did my prettiest to make a good record, for I knew the
eyes of several fair maidens from Rockspur were upon
me. I made our only touchdown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did?&#8221; cried Don, with incredulous emphasis on
the pronoun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; nodded Leon. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m one of the
heroes of the day! We didn&#8217;t get a goal off that touch,
either. It was in the first half, and the wind was against
Sterndale when he kicked, so we got only four points for
the touch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the other five must have been a goal kicked
from the field?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>&#8220;It was. Sterndale found in the last half that he could
not get the ball nearer than the fifteen-yard line to save
his soul, and so, in order to make the score look somewhat
more respectable, he took chances on getting a goal
from the field, and made it with as pretty a drop-kick as
ever you saw. But it was all chance,&#8221; Leon hastily added,
&#8220;for he failed once before that and once afterward. All
of Renwood&#8217;s coaching hasn&#8217;t shown him how to kick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did Highland make their points?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, just piled &#8217;em right up. They had a touchdown
and goal in less than three minutes after play began.
They made four touchdowns in the first half, but failed
to get goals off two of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was twenty of their thirty-three points. Then
Rockspur must have done better in the second half?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She did, rather,&#8221; nodded Leon. &#8220;Why, we even had
to give Highland two points by making a safety in order
to hold the ball one time in the first half. That gave
them twenty-two points out of the thirty-three.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, in the second half, they made only eleven points
to Rockspur&#8217;s five.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they had the advantage and they just fooled with
us. They were playing against the wind, too, same as we
were in the first half. But, you see, we couldn&#8217;t do anything,
even though we had the wind with us. Oh, this
game has shown up Renwood&#8217;s coaching in great style!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Renwood do?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>&#8220;Nothing at all that helped us any. Why, he actually
blocked Smith once and spoiled a run that might have
meant a touchdown. That was early in the game, when
we had the ball after Highland&#8217;s first goal. Of course, it
seemed like an accident that Renwood jumped square in
front of Smith, but I know it was nothing of the kind.
After that, when Highland had made a good lead, it
wasn&#8217;t necessary for him to spoil any of our plays, for he
saw we weren&#8217;t in the game, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you think it was his intention to throw the
game, in case it was close and he found an opportunity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anything about it, I know it!&#8221; declared
Bentley, as he produced a package of cigarettes and prepared
to smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; came sharply from Don; &#8220;you can&#8217;t do
that in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father would smell the smoke. Put them up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m dying for a whiff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to die or go outside. I&#8217;m not fooling. I
won&#8217;t have one of those things lighted in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Leon was compelled to reluctantly abandon the intended
smoke, although he did so grumblingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you so positive that Renwood meant to
throw the game?&#8221; asked Don, with mingled eagerness
and doubt. &#8220;He couldn&#8217;t do such a thing all by himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not unless it happened to be close and he found a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
good chance. But I know that&#8217;s what he&#8217;d done, just the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I have a way of keeping my eyes and ears open,&#8221;
wisely asserted Leon, piling his feet upon the doctor&#8217;s
desk in the midst of the papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you saw something?&mdash;you heard something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was impossible for Don to repress his eagerness.
Leon&#8217;s free-and-easy manner annoyed him, but he greatly
wished to know just what the fellow had seen and heard
that made him so absolutely positive of Renwood&#8217;s
treachery.</p>

<p>Don forgot for the time, at least, that only a few days
before he had told Leon that he wished to have nothing
further to do with a fellow of his sort. Having again
admitted the foxy young rascal to his home, having apparently
accepted him once more as a friend, his greatest
desire seemed to be to learn the full extent of the accusation
Bentley could make against Renwood.</p>

<p>Leon saw this. At first he had been somewhat surprised
by Don&#8217;s readiness to take him back on the old
footing without a show of continued resentment and
anger, and he had anticipated that he would have to whet
Scott&#8217;s appetite by hinting at the queer things he could
tell him about the game at Highland. Already devoured
by curiosity and a longing to know the full particulars
of the affair, Don had welcomed Leon almost with open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
arms, and Bentley believed friendly relations between
them had been re-established.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you see and hear?&#8221; breathed the doctor&#8217;s
son. &#8220;Tell me all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, just as soon as we arrived in Highland, I left
the others and hustled right up to the field where we were
to play. Renwood, with his sister and Dora Deland, had
passed us on the road, and he was in Highland when we
got there. I got to the field ahead of the others, and
there was Renwood talking with Winston, the Harvard
man, who has been coaching the Highlanders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They had their heads close together,&#8221; Bentley went
on, &#8220;and they were talking low. They didn&#8217;t see me, and
I just walked past them, stepping soft. I heard something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; panted Don. &#8220;What did you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard Winston say: &#8216;It means a heap to me if Highland
wins, and you don&#8217;t care a rap if Rockspur loses.&#8217;
Renwood answered: &#8216;Not a rap,&#8217; and he laughed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sneak! the traitor!&#8221; cried Don, springing to his
feet. &#8220;Did you hear anything more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Winston said: &#8216;These country yokels of mine
can&#8217;t kick much, and the centre of the line is weak. Just
get your captain to let the centre alone. Keep him trying
to go round the ends. Where is your weak point?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Renwood tell him?&#8221; demanded Scott, clutching
his companion fiercely by the shoulder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; exclaimed Leon, with a squirm. &#8220;I hurt that
to-day! Don&#8217;t! Yes, he told him all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he tell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said: &#8216;Our right end is weak, and the backs can&#8217;t
catch punts for a cent. As you say your men can&#8217;t kick,
you&#8217;ll have to keep hammering at our right end.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; panted Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Winston said: &#8216;Much obliged, old man; I won&#8217;t
forget it.&#8217; And Renwood returned: &#8216;That&#8217;s all right; I
haven&#8217;t forgotten what you did for me once.&#8217; That was
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was enough!&#8221; Don snarled, driving his clenched
right fist into the open palm of his left hand with a
cracking smack. &#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to see through that
dirty dog Renwood! At first I didn&#8217;t understand why
he should do anything to damage the team with which he
was playing, but now it&#8217;s plain enough that Winston has
done him some favor that he is trying to return in this
treacherous manner. And Sterndale thinks more of him
than of me! Did you tell Sterndale about this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried to, but he wouldn&#8217;t hear a word against Renwood,
and told me I&#8217;d better keep still. I saw it was no
use, and so I closed up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a fool!&#8221; raved Scott. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to tell him so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t do any good. The only way to convince
him is to show Renwood up so he can&#8217;t get around
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can that be done?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know now,&#8221; admitted Leon; &#8220;but I may find
a way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had picked up Dr. Scott&#8217;s check-book and was
coolly looking it over, which, being in an excited condition,
Don did not observe for some time. When he did
become aware what Leon was doing, after storming
about a while, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Put that down! What are you handling that for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I just happened to pick it up by accident,&#8221; said
the visitor, tossing it back on the desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so free with your hands!&#8221; advised the doctor&#8217;s
son.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get so excited,&#8221; calmly retorted Leon, fishing
into the waste-paper basket and pulling out a sheet of
paper on which there was some writing. &#8220;Say, your old
man&#8217;s scrawl is rather queer, ain&#8217;t it? But I guess I hit
his style all right in that note I faked up for you to carry
to old Alden, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was all right,&#8221; admitted Don, shortly, not fancying
the reference to that matter; &#8220;but you won&#8217;t have
to write any more for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never can tell, my boy,&#8221; chirped Bentley. &#8220;Say,
these are odd pens your dad uses. I rather like them,
and I think I&#8217;ll just take one to try it.&#8221; Whereupon he
calmly slipped one of the pens into his vest pocket.</p>

<p>For some time the boys talked over the football game
and Renwood&#8217;s treachery, as charged by Bentley. Finally,
Don said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;d better be getting out, Bent; father&#8217;s liable to
come pretty soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care about being seen by him,&#8221; grinned
Leon. &#8220;I know he doesn&#8217;t love me a great deal for some
reason or other.&#8221;</p>

<p>He arose to go. Neither of the boys had heard the
sound of wheels outside, being absorbed in their talk
about Renwood and the game, and now both were startled
by a footfall beyond the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s aunt!&#8221; breathed Don.</p>

<p>But it was not. The door opened, and Dr. Scott stood
before them.</p>

<small>THE DOCTOR&#8217;S STORY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The doctor was surprised, and a cloud came to his face
as his eyes fell on Leon Bentley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;What are you doing in here,
Don?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why,&#8221; stammered the boy questioned, &#8220;Leon
happened over, and we were just talking about the game,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; hastily put in the uneasy visitor, &#8220;I was just
telling him about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Telling him about it?&#8221; repeated the doctor, while
Don&#8217;s heart seemed to jump into his throat and throb
there. &#8220;Why, wasn&#8217;t he&mdash;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leon means we were talking over the plays and trying
to figure out just why we lost the game to-day,
father,&#8221; put in Don, with a warning glance at Bentley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then you lost the game, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad; but you might have discussed it elsewhere
than in my private office. Was it necessary to
bring your caller in here, my son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but he&mdash;he just dropped in for a minute. I was
writing a letter here, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the doctor; &#8220;but you know I do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
wish you to take visitors into my private office. I have
told you so before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The manner in which his father spoke these words
brought a hot flush to Don&#8217;s cheeks, but he bit his lip and
kept silent. Bentley sidled toward the door, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll be going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don followed him to the front door and let him out.
Outside, Leon paused and snickered, observing:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll catch it! The old duffer&#8217;s hot under the collar,
and he&#8217;ll give you a raking down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll thank you not to call my father an old duffer!&#8221;
flashed Don, in a fierce whisper. &#8220;I had no business to
take you in there, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that it did any harm, but I wouldn&#8217;t be in
your shoes for a quarter.&#8221; Then Bentley scudded away
and Don closed the door.</p>

<p>The boy was about to go upstairs when his father
called for him to come into the office, and he did so with
reluctance; for, although he knew the doctor would speak
with calmness and deliberation, he dreaded none the less
what might be said to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, my son,&#8221; said the doctor, who had taken
off his overcoat and was seated before his desk. &#8220;Are
you on very friendly terms with that Bentley boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;not very,&#8221; hesitated Don, feeling his face burning,
while he failed to meet the calm, steady eyes that
were regarding him intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very friendly, still you invited him into the house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
My son, I do not like that boy. I believe he is a bad boy.
He dresses extravagantly, though in poor taste, for all
that his parents are poor. Yet he never does any work
to earn money with which to get his clothes, rings, pins
and trinkets. He wears his hat tipped far over one ear,
loafs around the corners, smokes cigarettes and talks
slang. Not only that, but he uses low and profane language.
He has a treacherous face and shifty eyes. Now,
Don, I think such a boy is a very good person for you to
avoid, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Don did not know what to say, and so he remained
silent, whereupon his father spoke again:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to speak to you of this matter at this time, my
son, because I believe it may in a great measure concern
your future welfare. I wish to impress upon you the importance
of shunning evil companions, and, at the same
time, I will warn you again to guard your temper. I am
not going to preach a sermon, but I have decided to
tell you a story. I shall make it brief as possible, for it
is a painful matter, of which I do not like to think or
talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a single moment the doctor lifted his hand to his
bosom, where, within an inner pocket, close to his heart,
rested the gold-bound miniature of Don&#8217;s mother. The
boy knew his father had chosen this time to unbosom
himself in regard to an affair that doubtless had cast a
shadow over his life.</p>

<p>Despite his curiosity to know the truth of that affair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
Don was ill at ease and would have given much to escape
for the time the revelation. However, it was necessary
for him to sit still and listen, and, with as good grace as
possible, he composed himself to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, Don,&#8221; pursued Dr. Scott, lightly stroking his
well-trimmed iron-gray whiskers, &#8220;have the same
thoughtless, impetuous, passionate disposition that was
mine in my youthful days. It did not seem possible for
me to control my temper, which led me into doing many
things that I afterward regretted; but little did I dream
that, in a sudden outburst of anger, I was destined to
commit an act that would cause me long years of unspeakable
regret and sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother was a gentle woman, with a mild and
loving disposition, and I have often wondered if she
would have married me had she understood how thoroughly
unreasonable I could be when I gave way to my
uncontrollable temper. But I loved her, Don, and I tried
to make her happy. I believe I did during the first years
of our married life. It was only by one rash act of mine
that I brought sorrow to us both.</p>

<p>&#8220;She had a brother who was much younger than herself;
in fact, a mere boy when we were married. His
name was Charlie, and he was a bright, happy, jovial
youngster, full of life and good nature. Shortly after I
married your mother, her father died, leaving Charlie
an orphan and almost homeless, his mother, your
grandmother, having been dead some years. He might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
have found a home with relatives in California, but I
offered him a home with me, for I had taken a strong
fancy to the lad. Of course this greatly pleased your
mother, who set about the task of bringing Charlie up
in the proper manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;At that time I was a young physician, practicing my
profession in a small town in another State. I sent
Charlie to school, and, as he seemed unusually bright in
his studies, I resolved to give him the very best education
possible. This matter I talked over with your
mother, and we decided that he should be advanced as
rapidly as possible without injury to himself and should
finally be sent to one of the leading colleges of the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother became deeply absorbed in this project,
for she loved her brother with all the depth of her tender
nature, and she was ambitious for his success in the
world as a man of brains and education. Unfortunately,
there was in that town, small though it was, a fast set of
boys a little older than Charlie. They smoked and drank
and gambled, and they were proud to be known as the
&#8216;sporty set.&#8217; Charlie began to associate with them, and I
found it out. I was angry, and I talked to him harshly.
I know now that I did not in the right manner go about
showing him the error of his ways. I angered him,
and, as a result, instead of trusting me, he began to deceive
me, associating without my knowledge with the
same set of bad boys. It did not seem to him that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
very bad to smoke a little, to swear occasionally, to take
a drink now and then, or to play a game of penny poker,
with a ten-cent limit. He was only sixteen years old
when he began to do these things.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said nothing to your mother about it, for I knew it
would worry and distress her, and, for some time, I fancied
my talk to him had been productive of good results.
But I was wrong, for I finally learned that he still associated
with his bad companions, which made me more
angry than before. I did not tell his sister, but I threatened
to turn him out of doors. To my astonishment, he
was defiant and told me to go ahead and turn him out.
It was with difficulty that I kept my hands off him then,
but I did so.</p>

<p>&#8220;After that he did not take so much pains to hide from
me the fact that he still preferred for companions the fast
set of the little village. He neglected his studies and
would not attend school regularly. One day I missed
some money, and, in a towering rage, I accused Charlie
of taking it. Then, becoming angry, he called me a bad
name, whereupon I drove him from the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;This scene was witnessed by your mother, Don, who
could not believe me when I told her the truth regarding
her brother. She was certain that I must be mistaken,
and she set about searching for the lost money. She
found it where I had dropped it at the bath-room door,
and then, of course, she was doubly certain that I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
mistaken in regard to the other charges I had made
against Charlie.</p>

<p>&#8220;By that time I was ashamed and sorry, and I was
willing to try to rectify my mistake. I was also willing
for her to continue to think her brother too good to
choose evil associates who smoked, swore, drank and
gambled. So I went to Charlie, told him I had found
the money, and asked him to forget. It was a difficult
thing for me to do, but I did it for love of your mother,
my son.</p>

<p>&#8220;From that time on, however, Charlie disliked me
more than ever. He did not reform, and his gambling
assumed a more serious nature. The time came when he
was in desperate straits for money. At this time he was
seventeen, being large for his years. Coming home unexpectedly
one day, I found him in my private office, with
the safe door open. He was stooping before the safe
when I entered, but he sprang up and wheeled about, and
in his hand was some money he had taken from the safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the doctor paused, the listening boy noticed a quiver
of the hand he again lifted to stroke his beard. The expression
on his fine face was one of mingled pain and
sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I scarcely know what followed,&#8221; he resumed. &#8220;Of
course I had caught him in the act, and I called him a
thief. He said I had called him that before, and he was
bound not to have the name without the game. Then I
sprang upon him in a perfect tempest of fury. As I said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
he was large and strong for his years, and he gave me a
severe tussle for a few moments, but I succeeded in getting
him by the throat and throwing him. As he fell his
head struck against a sharp corner of the safe. When he
struck the floor, he lay there still and limp, the color going
out of his face. There was a shriek behind me, and I
turned to see your mother in the door, brought to the spot
by the sounds of our struggle. She sprang over and
lifted the head of her brother, staining her hands and her
dress with his blood, for the corner of the safe had cut a
gash in the back of his head. I can never forget the terrible
look she gave me. &#8216;You have murdered Charlie!&#8217;
she hoarsely cried, and then she swooned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the man stopped, deeply affected by the tragic
picture painted for him by memory as he told of this
fateful encounter which had brought upon him the sorrow
of his life. For some moments he turned about in
his office chair and stared at the window, as if trying to
gaze out into the darkness, lifting to his face one hidden
hand, while the other shook as it reached out to rest upon
his desk.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;s sympathies were stirred most profoundly, for he
saw how much pain it was costing his father to relate to
him this story of which he had never spoken. Unable to
keep still, the boy impulsively cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me any more, father! That is enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Scott turned back from the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is not much more to tell,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
complete the story now. I called assistance and sent for
medical aid. Your mother was taken to her room, where
she lay unconscious so long that I feared she might never
recover. When at last she again came to herself, she lay
like one dazed until I entered the room, when she
shrieked, covered her face and would not look at me. In
her condition, it was necessary for me to leave her before
she would become quiet. That night, my son, you came
into the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Charlie,&#8221; palpitated Don, &#8220;was he&mdash;dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but he was seriously injured&mdash;how seriously
could not be told at the time. He slowly recovered his
physical strength, but the blow from the sharp point of
the safe had clouded his mind and he was insane&mdash;violently
so at times. It was necessary that he should be
confined, for he was dangerous when violent, so he was
placed in a private asylum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my son! you can never know how much I regretted
my outbreak of anger that had caused me to attack
him and bring this about! That is, you can never
know unless some rash act of your own shall bring an
equal sorrow upon you. I had everything possible done
to make poor Charlie comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he was to blame&mdash;he was to blame for it all!&#8221;
panted the listening lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have tried to think so,&#8221; confessed the doctor, &#8220;but
in my sober moments of reason I found it impossible.
Bad company led him into bad ways, it is true; but I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
not patient with him, and I did not talk to him in the
right spirit when I discovered that he was associating
with bad boys. I permitted my anger to govern me, and
thus, instead of influencing him to do better, I aroused in
him anger and resentment against me. When I did that,
my power over him was gone, and I never recovered it.
It is thus, I believe, that in many cases parents lose influence
and power over their children. They give themselves
over to anger in attempting to reprimand their
sons or daughters for wrong-doing, and their unrestrained
temper produces resentment and anger, instead
of regret and resolution to do better, in the ones whom
they reprimand. My son, guard your temper and keep
it in subjection, for to one of your fiery and unreasoning
disposition it is your worst enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; murmured Don, &#8220;did&mdash;did she&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She recovered for the time, but the shock had shattered
her health, and she was never herself again.
Even the sight of her aroused Charlie, so that the manager
of the asylum ceased, after a time, to permit her to
visit him. At sight of me he had convulsions. My practice
was ruined, and it became necessary for me to seek
another field. Then, my son, we came here, where we
have remained ever since. Your mother grew weaker
and weaker day by day. I doctored her as best I could,
seeking the advice and assistance of the most skilled
physicians obtainable; but it was useless, for her ailment
was not of the body, but of the mind. She forgave me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
everything, but I lost her, Don, and I can never forgive
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the doctor turned his sad, handsome face away,
and father and son sat in silence, the only sound being
the steady, solemn ticking of the old-fashioned clock that
stood outside in the hall. After some minutes, the boy
ventured to ask:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Charlie still crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered the doctor; &#8220;it was less than a year
after the death of your mother that a certain great surgeon
operated upon him and restored him to reason. Oh,
how much would I have given had Mary lived till that
day!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In California, whither he went immediately on regaining
his reason and liberty. I offered him a home as
long as he wished to remain with me, but he chose to go
to California.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is all the story, my son, and, having completed
it, I am not going to moralize. Think it over. I hope
it may serve to open your eyes to the perils of keeping
bad company, and I pray that it may teach you to guard
your temper.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor arose and held out his hand, as one man
offers his hand to another, upon which Don sprang forward
impulsively, clasping it with both of his own. The
boy longed to express his sympathy in words, but something
choked him, and he gazed through a misty cloud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
at the sadly handsome face of his father, while the pressure
of their hands alone spoke more directly to their
hearts than aught words could have expressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Don, my boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, father&mdash;good-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>Don turned from the room and ascended the stairs,
while his father, left alone, drew from that pocket near
his heart the gold-bound miniature, which, with a smothered
sob, he lifted to his lips.</p>

<small>THE DEFEATED ELEVEN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Twelve boys of various ages and sizes, their faces expressing
untold disgust, sat around in the so-called &#8220;reading-room&#8221;
of the Rockspur Athletic Club. They were
seated on the table, benches and chairs, and a woe-be-gone,
disheartened-appearing set of fellows they were.
The big Rochester kerosene lamp with a smoky chimney
shed over them a melancholy light that seemed quite
befitting to their mood. Finally, Sterndale looking around
at his companions, and finding something decidedly comical
in their aspect, laughed aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kill him!&#8221; cried Jotham Sprout.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything to laugh at,&#8221; groaned Walter
Mayfair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too sus-sus-sore to laugh, anyway,&#8221; sighed Danny
Chatterton.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Oi feel loike foightin&#8217;!&#8221; burst from Dennis
Murphy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so lame I can hardly draw my breath,&#8221; confessed
Rob Linton. &#8220;I&#8217;m lame from my head to my heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have bruises and contusions and gashes all over
me,&#8221; declared John Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;I raked my right arm from the wrist to the elbow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
when I made that touchdown,&#8221; put in Leon Bentley, in a
manner that called attention to the accomplishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the greatest fluke of the game,&#8221; said Sterndale.
&#8220;It was a streak of luck for the ball to roll right
out of a scrimmage, in which you were carefully taking
no part, just so you could pick it up with a clear field
ahead of you and get over Highland&#8217;s line with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No fluke about it!&#8221; flared Leon. &#8220;No luck about it,
either! I wasn&#8217;t going into the thing pell-mell, like the
rest of you fellows, and I had my eyes open. That&#8217;s how
it happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I noticed that you didn&#8217;t go into much of anything
pell-mell,&#8221; yawned Thad Boland, sleepily. &#8220;You kept out
of danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! What have you got to say about it? You
wouldn&#8217;t know a good play if you saw it, you big, lazy
duffer!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thad pulled himself together somewhat and gave Leon
a look.</p>

<p>&#8220;You better not get too gay with your mouth,&#8221; he
drawled, &#8220;or I may take a notion to shake you. It would
be lots of trouble, but I can&#8217;t swallow too much of your
sass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bentley did not care to arouse the lazy lad, for Boland
had the strength of a young giant, though it was on very
rare occasions that he saw fit to display it; so Leon
lighted a fresh cigarette, contenting himself by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all jealous of me, but I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>&#8220;Jealous of you!&#8221; came derisively from Rob Linton.
&#8220;That would make a cat laugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what did you do in the game?&#8221; demanded Bent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I did something! Didn&#8217;t I tackle Dow and keep
him from making a touchdown?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Hartford got one two minutes later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble with you, Bent,&#8221; said Rob, &#8220;is that you
think you are the only thing that ever happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble with you,&#8221; retorted Leon, quickly, &#8220;is
that you think you are the whole menagerie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t sus-sus-see ha-how he can think so wh-when
you&#8217;re round,&#8221; chuckled Danny Chatterton. &#8220;He-he-his
eyes must sus-sus-show him there is another mum-mum-monkey
in the show.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bentley did not relish the laughter that followed this,
and he growled and grumbled to himself, after which he
smoked and sulked in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ford hasn&#8217;t expressed his opinion of the game,&#8221;
grinned Sprout, who was chewing gum and eating peppermint
candy at the same time, has fat cheeks shaking
as he wagged his jaws.</p>

<p>They looked at the mute, who seemed to understand on
the instant what had been said, and he made a gesture
expressive of dejection and disgust, slowly shaking his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Misther Rinwood isn&#8217;t afther sayin&#8217; a great dale,&#8221; observed
Dennis Murphy, a sly twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>Renwood was sitting astride a chair, his elbows on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
back of it, his chin resting on his hands. He grinned in
a sickly manner, showing his lips were battered and
bruised, the under one being swelled till it projected almost
as far as his nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lips are too sore to make much talk,&#8221; he declared,
rather thickly. &#8220;And some of my teeth are so loose I&#8217;m
afraid they&#8217;ll fall out when I open my mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, fellows,&#8221; said Sterndale, &#8220;we&#8217;re a sorry-looking
crowd, but it&#8217;s no use to mope over being defeated.
That&#8217;s only one out of three with Highland, and they
took the first ball game last summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they didn&#8217;t snow us under,&#8221; came quickly from
Mayfair. &#8220;They barely won by a fluke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I made the fluke,&#8221; acknowledged John Smith,
smiling grimly at the remembrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you saved us on the last game of the series by
your great work in the box,&#8221; Mayfair hastened to assert.
&#8220;You made up for that first game, old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he did some splendid work in our game to-day,&#8221;
said the captain of the eleven. &#8220;If we&#8217;d all done as well
as Smith, we might have won the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>John flushed with pleasure, for such praise from
Sterndale was most agreeable. Leon Bentley looked
through a cloud of blue smoke, his lips curling scornfully,
but he remained silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Sterndale,&#8221; agreed Dolph Renwood.
&#8220;Smith was a perfect whirlwind. Several times he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
great work at interference, even though he was playing
back of the line. If he&#8217;d been in his old position&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Renwood stopped, and Harry Carter spoke up at once:</p>

<p>&#8220;I did the best I could, fellows. I know I made some
bad blunders, but I didn&#8217;t shirk, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right,&#8221; Dolph interrupted; &#8220;but you
haven&#8217;t had the practice, and you were given a hard position
in the line. Now, if you had been placed next to
the end, with Smith on the end&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you digging at me?&#8221; asked Bentley, snappily.
&#8220;I was playing next to the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not digging at anybody,&#8221; calmly answered the
quarter-back of the team; &#8220;but I know we should have
had Smith on that end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been too much shifting about,&#8221; said Leon.
&#8220;You fellows took in Boland and Carter, and then you
tried Linton at right tackle till you found Ford wouldn&#8217;t
work beside Old Lightning. That made you shift back,
and finally you decided you couldn&#8217;t get along without
me, after all, which caused another change.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve not had enough time for practice,&#8221; Sterndale
asserted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had as much as Highland,&#8221; grinned Leon,
lighting another cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not by a whole week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It counts when all the practice a team gets is secured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
in two or three weeks. College teams begin to practice
months ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And sometimes there are changes in the make-up of
a college team one day before a great game,&#8221; put in
Renwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume you know all about it,&#8221; purred Leon, with
a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I know something about it. I&#8217;ve had a chance
to see considerable of Harvard&#8217;s training work, and some
of the Harvard men are my friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For instance, Phil Winston, who is the Highland
coach. I suppose he is one of your friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I happen to know Winston,&#8221; confessed Dolph, &#8220;but
that is all. We are not friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Bentley, queerly, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know but you
were.&#8221; And the tone and manner in which the words
were spoken attracted attention.</p>

<p>Renwood gave Leon no further notice, but turned to
the others, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what it is, fellows, we met with a big loss
when Scott got his back up and left the eleven. With
that fellow in his old position and Smith back on the end,
I believe we might give Highland a hot game a week
from to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use to talk about that,&#8221; said Sterndale, gloomily.
&#8220;Scott won&#8217;t come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; nodded Leon. &#8220;I just saw him by accident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
a little while ago, and he&#8217;s in high spirits because
we got beaten. He says he&#8217;ll never play again on any
kind of a team with Renwood or Sterndale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard fuf-fellows make that kuk-kind of tut-talk
before,&#8221; said Chatterton, sprawling out on the top of the
reading table.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he means it,&#8221; cried Bent. &#8220;When Scott gets his
back up, he sticks to a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; declared Renwood, tenderly touching
his damaged lips. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know of a man who can fill
his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s changed his tune about Scott lately,&#8221; whispered
Leon, giving Jotham Sprout a nudge in the ribs with his
elbow, upon which the fat boy fell off the end of the
bench and landed on the floor with a crash that shook the
building.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do that again!&#8221; gasped Bubble, sitting up
and choking, having swallowed his gum in the midst of
the catastrophe. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to know who you think you&#8217;re
pushin&#8217;! I won&#8217;t set side of you no more!&#8221; Then he
proceeded to make himself comfortable on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t want to &#8216;set&#8217; beside me, you may &#8216;lay&#8217; on
the floor,&#8221; grinned Bentley, looking around to see if anybody
present took notice of the pun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Egg-egg-eggs-actly,&#8221; cackled Chatterton. Then he
quickly put up his hands, crying: &#8220;Don&#8217;t sus-sus-shoot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody oughter hit you with a good, hard piece of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
iron,&#8221; slowly declared Thad Boland. &#8220;You committed a
crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sterndale stood up.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must do something, fellows,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is
no question about that. Unless the team is strengthened
greatly, Highland will have another easy time when we
meet them next Saturday. If they win that game, it settles
the series, and there&#8217;ll be no need to play the third
game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If necessary,&#8221; said Redwood, &#8220;and if you fellows
think it best, I&#8217;ll go to Scott and see if I can&#8217;t get him to
come back onto the team. I should hate to do anything
of the sort, but I&#8217;m willing to do &#8217;most anything that is
honest so that we may win the next game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leon Bentley groaned, softly and derisively.</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds first rate,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;but you can&#8217;t
fool some people.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were spoken loudly enough for some of the
boys to understand them, but Dolph, who was at the farther
side of the room, did not catch them distinctly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you say, Bentley?&#8221; he demanded, sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say that sounds first rate, but you can&#8217;t get Scott
if you go down on your knees to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps that was what you said,&#8221; admitted Renwood;
&#8220;but it didn&#8217;t sound like it. I&#8217;m not going down on my
knees to Scott, but I am going to speak to him, no matter
what he may do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do that, Renwood,&#8221; said Sterndale, scowling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
a little. &#8220;If anybody says anything to that fellow, it
is my place to do so. I have not yet decided that I&#8217;d take
him back onto the eleven if he came and asked to play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed Leon, promptly,
showing satisfaction. &#8220;The team is all right just as it
is, if it gets the right kind of practice work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you mean that I have not been giving it the
right kind of practice?&#8221; Dolph cried. &#8220;Perhaps you
know more about coaching a team than I do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that, either,&#8221; grinned Bentley.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seldom say anything point-blank to a man&#8217;s face,
but you insinuate and insinuate, and you talk behind his
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Mr. Renwood,&#8221; Leon angrily snapped, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t fancy that! I&#8217;ve always used you all right, and
you have no reason for making that kind of talk. I won&#8217;t
stand any more of it, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Renwood shrugged his shoulders and turned to Sterndale,
with whom he began to talk earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ginger!&#8221; cried Carter, starting up as the town clock
in the Baptist church tower began to strike. &#8220;It&#8217;s nine
o&#8217;clock! I told mother I&#8217;d be back before this. I&#8217;ve got
some groceries to take home, and the stores will be
closed. Good-night, fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was hurrying out when Bentley also arose and remarked
that he was going home, following Harry down
the stairs. As Carter came out upon the street, Leon
overtook him and grasped his arm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;Look here, Cart,&#8221; he said, &#8220;can&#8217;t you see through this
little game?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What game?&#8221; asked the boy addressed, turning
sharply and shaking off the hand of his follower, whom
he did not like. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why Renwood&#8217;s game, of course. It&#8217;s plain enough.
He doesn&#8217;t want Rockspur to win, for all that he makes
the bluff that he does. He has Sterndale on a string, and
he&#8217;s the real manager and captain of the eleven. It was
through him that all the shifting about on the team has
come, and now he wants to make another shift. He&#8217;s
sore because I made that touchdown, so he&#8217;s going to
try to push me off. He&#8217;ll try to get Scott back into your
place; then where will you be? He is going to keep this
thing up just so that the team will be unsettled all the
time, and that will fix us so that we&#8217;ll never win a game.
Now, Carter, are you going to stand it? That&#8217;s the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leon had tried to appear very earnest and sincere, but
he made very little impression on the listening youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t take any stock in that stuff, Bentley,&#8221; declared
Harry, promptly. &#8220;I know I&#8217;m not as good a man as
Scott on the team, which makes me willing to get off any
time Sterndale wants to fill my place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yah!&#8221; snarled Leon, showing his yellow teeth.
&#8220;You&#8217;re just like all the rest; you&#8217;ll let Dick Sterndale
wipe his feet all over you. I&#8217;m sick of the whole crowd;
but I&#8217;m just as good a man as anybody on that team, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
I&#8217;ll show Dolph Renwood up if he comes any sneaky business
to throw me down!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, lighting a fresh cigarette, and hearing other boys
descending the stairs from the club-room, he hurried
away, muttering to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those nasty things he is smoking are turning his
head,&#8221; said Carter, to himself. &#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t stop using
so many of them, he&#8217;ll go daffy, for I can see that he&#8217;s
getting worse and worse every day.&#8221;</p>

<small>FANNING THE FLAMES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Leon was waiting for Don at the first corner when the
latter started for school the following Monday morning.
As usual, he was puffing a cigarette. The sight of him
angered Don, who would have hurried straight on without
speaking, but Bentley joined him, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was watching for you, old man. Got something to
tell you. I went down to the club-room after your dad
came in on us so jerky Saturday night, and I found all
the gang there, weeping over their defeat. It would have
done you good to see them. A big lot of cry-babies!
They had something to say about you, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had hurried on with his words, being shrewd
enough to observe that the doctor&#8217;s son was in no very
agreeable mood, and, as he anticipated, the final statement
aroused Don&#8217;s curiosity, although an attempt was
made to conceal it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose I care what they say about
me!&#8221; growled the dark-eyed lad, with a toss of his head.
&#8220;They can say any old thing they like.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he slackened his pace somewhat and did not try to
shake off his unwelcome companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were saying every old thing,&#8221; asserted Leon. &#8220;I
tell you, they gave you a raking down behind your back.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>&#8220;That didn&#8217;t hurt me any. I wasn&#8217;t on their old team,
so they couldn&#8217;t blame me for their defeat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they did, just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don stopped short and looked at Bentley, his face
growing hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;How the dickens could they do that?&#8221; he snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they said you acted like a fool in getting your
back up and leaving the team. They said they were glad
enough to get rid of you, but they&#8217;d ought to have fired
you in the first place. As it was, you left at a bad time,
making it necessary to shift the men around, so there
was no time to get the team back in shape, and, for that
reason, you were responsible for the loss of the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leon told this lie glibly and with a show of truthfulness
that aroused no suspicion in the mind of the hearer;
but the falsehood did the work Bentley wished it to do,
and the black look deepened on the rather handsome face
of Don Scott, marring his good looks and making his aspect
repellent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who said this, Bentley?&#8221; he demanded, harshly.
&#8220;Was it that treacherous snake, Renwood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; nodded Leon. &#8220;He blames it all onto
you, but he ain&#8217;t the only one. The others agreed with
him, and I told them what I thought of it. I don&#8217;t often
get right up and speak out in meeting,&#8221; the fellow went
on, &#8220;but I couldn&#8217;t keep still this time, so I said enough
to get them all mad at me. Now, I hear that they&#8217;re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
going to kick me out again. What do you think of that,
Don?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it serves you right for going back onto the
team,&#8221; was the unsympathetic answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What? You say that after I stood up for you? Well,
I never thought such a thing of you, Scott!&#8221; Leon assumed
an injured air, giving Don a look of deep reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble with you is that you&#8217;re altogether too
shifty,&#8221; said the doctor&#8217;s son. &#8220;When you do a thing,
stick to it. But I&#8217;m not kicking at you. I&#8217;d like to hit
Renwood for wagging his mouth about me so much!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what you ought to do. Of course he would deny
it, but you know what he is. Why, he even denied to you
that he meant you when he said there were some men on
the team who were no earthly good, but he&#8217;s laughed
about it since, saying he didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d tumble to
yourself so quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sound of grating teeth came from Don&#8217;s mouth, delighting
Leon with the knowledge that he had reawakened
to the full extent the hatred of the dark-eyed
youth for Dolph Renwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll come a day of settlement!&#8221; Scott panted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that he is sore on me, you can&#8217;t imagine what he
proposes to do,&#8221; snickered Bentley. &#8220;Why I have it
straight that he&#8217;s going to come to you and try to get
you back onto the eleven, just so he can kick me out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him come!&#8221; cried Don. &#8220;That is what I want.
I&#8217;ll tell him a few things!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>They had proceeded up the hill till they were in sight
of the white academy, which showed through the trees
of the grounds. Now, fully satisfied with himself and
what he had done, Bentley stopped, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;d better not go up together. The fellows
have charged me with carrying things to you, and they
may suspect that I&#8217;ve put you onto Renwood&#8217;s game.
You go ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Don walked on and Leon came up later. Knowing
Bentley as he did, it was rather surprising that the doctor&#8217;s
son permitted himself to be deceived by the fellow;
but he was ready to believe almost anything bad of Renwood,
which, with his hatred and prejudice, blinded his
sense of perception.</p>

<p>Renwood had not arrived at the academy and did not
appear till a few moments before the beginning of the
morning session, giving him no opportunity to speak with
Scott, in case he desired to do so. That noon, however,
the coach of the eleven was talking with Chatterton beneath
one of the large oaks near the entrance to the
grounds, when Don came through the gate. Perceiving
Scott, Dolph immediately advanced toward him, calling:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to speak with you, Scott, if you&#8217;ll wait a
minute. We can talk here without being overheard by
the fellows up by the steps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing to say to you that I&#8217;m not willing anybody
should hear,&#8221; declared Don, holding himself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
check, for Leon&#8217;s warning had informed him what was
coming, and he was glad of the opportunity to again express
himself to this fellow whom he hated with all the
intensity of his nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, it&#8217;s better to talk the matter over out here away
from the others,&#8221; said Dolph, rather nervously, his manner
seeming to betray to the boy with the searching eyes
a self-consciousness of guilt. &#8220;I am in hopes we can come
to an understanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don said nothing, but continued to watch Renwood&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something about me,&#8221; Dolph continued,
seeming troubled to find words to express himself, &#8220;that
caused you to take a strong dislike to me almost the
first time you saw me. I knew it, for you are not a chap
to conceal your feelings. I have some pride and spirit of
my own, and I&#8217;m not the kind of a fellow to try to curry
favor with those who dislike me, for which reason I had
very little to do with you till the football team was organized,
and I was selected as coach. Then it became
necessary for me to have some dealings with you. One
thing I want to claim right here is, that I never tried to
injure you in any way.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was curling scorn in the movement of Don&#8217;s
lips, but he continued silent, apparently waiting with
some impatience for Renwood to finish. Dolph saw and
understood the expression on the face of his enemy, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
he pretended to take no note of it, hurrying on with
scarcely a break:</p>

<p>&#8220;When Sterndale was making up the team, I suggested
that you be tried in the position you were given, one of
the most prominent and difficult places on an eleven. I
had observed that you could run like a deer, could dodge
and handle yourself gracefully, and I fancied you possessed,
or could develop, other requirements that would
make you a first-class man at half. I made one mistake,&#8221;
the coach confessed, &#8220;for, in instructing the team, I did
not take into consideration the fact that you might be
easily angered, so that you would quit the eleven and refuse
to come back. I don&#8217;t think I quite understood you
in that respect. Anyhow, you got mad with me, which
has raised hob with everything. I used you just exactly
the same as I did others on the team, but you seemed to
think I had some spite against you. You were wrong,
Scott; I had nothing in the world against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By that,&#8221; said Don, with a sneer, &#8220;I presume you
infer that I was wholly to blame for everything that occurred?
When you jumped on me and made your insulting
remarks to me before the eleven and the whole
crowd of spectators, I had no right to resent it! I should
have curled up and taken it, like a meaching cur! But
I&#8217;m not that kind of a huckleberry! I don&#8217;t belong to
the whipped-cur breed, Mr. Dolph Renwood!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I made a mistake,&#8221; Dolph again acknowledged, still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
speaking calmly. &#8220;You must remember that I belonged
to a city team, and that team was coached by a professional.
You should have heard him talk to us! Why,
there wasn&#8217;t a man in the whole bunch that he didn&#8217;t
give a tongue-lashing. If I had begun to talk that way
to the boys here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You started in,&#8221; declared Don. &#8220;Just because a professional
coach could talk that way, you tried to show off
by doing so; but you found out it wouldn&#8217;t go in this
town, and so you had to come down some. That&#8217;s about
the size of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Renwood&#8217;s face had been pale, but now a sudden flush
burned in his cheeks, making it plain that Scott&#8217;s words
and bearing were arousing his pride and anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not talk of that,&#8221; he cried, perceiving it would
do no good. &#8220;We were beaten at Highland, Saturday,
and the eleven must be strengthened somehow if we are
to stand a show with them when they come here next
Saturday. If we had you back in your old position, I
think there would be a chance of making the team strong
enough to meet those fellows. I confess that I&#8217;m sorry
I offended you. I&#8217;ll even apologize if you demand it!
I&#8217;ll do anything to make the team strong enough to beat
Highland.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don laughed harshly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know me, Renwood,&#8221;
he declared. &#8220;I have said I was done with you,
and I mean it. I&#8217;ve said I&#8217;d show you up as a sneak and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
a traitor, and I meant that, too! I know you for just
what you are. You pretend that you are anxious to beat
Highland. Bah! You&#8217;re hand-and-glove with Phil Winston,
the Highland coach. You owe him favors, which
you are trying to pay by throwing down Rockspur. I
know it! That strikes home, doesn&#8217;t it! Wait&mdash;keep
still! I&#8217;m going to say all I have to say to you right here
and now. You must think me a soft fool to come back
onto the team with you after what I know about you!
You know that I know it, too! You know I know you
slashed the suits and cut up the football in the dressing-room
under the grand-stand! Yet you had the crust to
face me and try to paste that onto me! As far as you
have been able you have hurt me, for the most of the boys
are idiots enough to believe I did that job. Now, you
are sore on Bentley because he happened to get a touchdown
in the Highland game, and you want to dump him
off the team. You see that you must do something to
hold your grip with the boys and make them believe you
are trying hard to put a winning eleven on the field, and
so you&#8217;ve planned to dump Bent and make a bluff at doing
something all at one lick. Renwood, you&#8217;re so thin
I can see through you like window-glass. Some day all
the fellows will see through you. I&#8217;ve told you just what
I think of you, and you can chew on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don was about to turn away, but, panting and pale,
Dolph caught him by the arm, huskily exclaiming:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;Stop! I&#8217;ve got something more to say to you! I
see I&#8217;ve made a fool of myself for nothing. I might
have known you were unreasonable and obstinate enough
to keep the thing up. Talk about bluffing! You are the
champion! After stealing my knife right from under my
nose in the club-room, you saw a way to hurt me, as you
fancied, and you went up to the field and slashed the
suits and cut up the football with that knife, which you
left there so that it would seem I did it. Then you told
a preposterous story about encountering me in the room
and tried to make the boys believe I attempted to stab
you. I was willing to overlook all that, not because I
forgave you, but because I was anxious for the good of
the eleven; but now I want to tell you just what I think,
as you have pretended to tell me. You&#8217;re a miserable&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dolph! Dolph!&#8221; cried a voice, and Zadia, having entered
by the gate, accompanied by other girls, rushed between
the two panting lads, who were about to fly at
each other&#8217;s throats. Putting a hand against the breast
of each, she held them apart with all her strength, gasping:
&#8220;You shall not! You shall not! Stop this minute.
Remember your promise to me, Don Scott!&#8221;</p>

<p>Don did not draw back immediately, but at last he
took his eyes, full of intense rancor, from the face of
Renwood and turned them upon Dolph&#8217;s pretty, trembling,
imploring sister. Swiftly he melted before her entreating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
gaze, but he could not resist the impulse to hurl
a last savage shot at the fellow he hated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time, Renwood,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your sister will not
be at hand to come between us. Then look out for yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>With which, he turned toward the academy.</p>

<small>DON DECIDES TO PLAY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Sterndale came down from the football field in a discouraged
condition, although he tried not to betray his
feelings. He could see the boys had lost confidence in
themselves, with the exception of Bentley, who was full
of conceit and arrogance, seeming to regard himself as
the only player of consequence on the team.</p>

<p>On his way home, Dick almost ran against Don Scott.
It was growing dark, and something was the matter with
the street lamp on that corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Scott, wait a minute!&#8221; exclaimed the captain of
the nine, catching hold of the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a hurry,&#8221; muttered Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind; you can give me five minutes for old
times&#8217; sake. You and I got along pretty well on the
baseball team. We never had any particular trouble,
did we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this trouble on the eleven is all nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Needn&#8217;t been any trouble only for that sneak Renwood,
Sterndale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how it was. See here, Scott, do you want to
see Highland get the best of us and crow over us just
because you had a row with Renwood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>&#8220;I know you don&#8217;t!&#8221; declared Dick, with a show of
satisfaction. &#8220;I&#8217;ve felt it all along! I was sure that,
deep down in your heart, you wanted us to win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only Renwood,&#8221; muttered Don, hesitatingly. &#8220;If
you hadn&#8217;t had him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had to, old man. We didn&#8217;t know beans about
football, and he did. We couldn&#8217;t afford to hire a coach,
and he&#8217;s coached us for nothing. There we were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he hasn&#8217;t tried to coach you to win. I know it!
He&#8217;s standing in with Winston, who is working for a
rep. I have it straight, Sterndale. The sooner you get
rid of Renwood the better off the eleven will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think that. I want proof. Prove what you
say and I&#8217;ll kick him out on the jump.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I bring a man who heard him talking with Winston&mdash;who
heard enough to learn there is an understanding
between them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m satisfied the man isn&#8217;t lying, I&#8217;ll kick Renwood
off the team,&#8221; declared Dick.</p>

<p>Don realized on the instant that the captain would not
believe Leon Bentley, so it was useless to bring Bentley
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t believe it, Scott,&#8221; the big leader of the
village boys went on. &#8220;You have misjudged Dolph Renwood.
He feels as bad as anybody over our defeat, and
he&#8217;ll work hard to help us win, Saturday. But there&#8217;s a
weakness in our team. We want you back at half, and
then we can put Smith on the end of the line, where he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
was in the first place. Can&#8217;t you let bygones be bygones,
old man, and come back and help pull us out of the hole?
You can bet your life I&#8217;ll appreciate it if you do! Now,
don&#8217;t say you won&#8217;t, Don! I&#8217;ve favored you before now,
and I&#8217;m ready to do it again. Of course you&#8217;ll do this
for me! I know you will!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something almost irresistible in Sterndale&#8217;s
manner, so that Don found it nearly impossible to refuse
his entreaty; but the doctor&#8217;s son was not to be turned
thus easily from his determination to keep off the eleven
as long as Renwood had anything to do with it, and he
grimly shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; he muttered, sullenly. &#8220;It&#8217;s no use to
ask me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even for me? Not even to save Rockspur from
being defeated by Highland?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even for anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick was disappointed and nettled, but he held his
anger in check, though he betrayed his disappointment
plainly enough. Almost always the village boys were
ready to obey his beck and call, and he found it decidedly
provoking to have Scott refuse in this case to come back
onto the eleven at his request.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll think better of it,&#8221; the captain said, not willing
to give up defeated. &#8220;I&#8217;m your friend; I&#8217;ve proved it,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick did not say outright that he had proved it by not
going to Don&#8217;s father about the ruined suits and destroyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
football, but his meaning was plain enough, and
Scott cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re no friend of mine if you think I did that dirty
piece of business! That was one of Renwood&#8217;s tricks,
as you&#8217;ll find out some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying you did it,&#8221; the captain instantly cut
in. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know who did it. I don&#8217;t want to think
that either you or Renwood would do a thing like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of us did it, and it wasn&#8217;t me,&#8221; assented Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, never mind that now. I want you back on the
team, and you are coming back. We can&#8217;t get along
without you, Scott, old man! You can save us from defeat.
We can&#8217;t shift all over again, but we can put the
men back in their original positions, and we&#8217;ll beat the
stuffing out of Highland. I&#8217;m going to see you again
about this, so think it over. Remember, that I am asking
this of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he got hold of Don&#8217;s hand, shook it warmly, said
something pleasant, and they parted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hated to refuse him,&#8221; muttered Don, who still felt
the effect of Dick&#8217;s influence and magnetism, &#8220;but I had
to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He remained obstinate when Sterndale approached him
again on the following day, and there seemed little prospect
that he would give in and resume his old position on
the eleven.</p>

<p>The boys practiced faithfully every day, regardless of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
weather; but Scott kept away from the field and Bentley
was well satisfied.</p>

<p>It was Thursday morning at breakfast that Dr. Scott,
who was looking over the little country newspaper published
at Highland, suddenly lowered the paper and,
glancing keenly at Don, observed:</p>

<p>&#8220;How is this, my son? Didn&#8217;t you do anything
worthy of note in the game at Highland last Saturday?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy nearly dropped the glass of milk he had been
lifting to his lips, for he instantly realized that his father
had been reading an account of the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no&mdash;I&mdash;that is&mdash;not much of anything,&#8221; he
stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see the <i>Register</i> does not even mention your name,&#8221;
smiled the doctor. &#8220;It speaks of the plays of a number
of men on both sides, but nothing is said of a chap by
the name of Scott.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it give the line-up of the two teams?&#8221; breathlessly
questioned Don, his heart standing still.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;It seems to me a very careless
piece of reporting, and it&#8217;s plain the fellow who did it
doesn&#8217;t know much about football.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy breathed again, but he still shook a little, feeling
a clammy perspiration on his face. He had kept up
the deception so long that the horror of the seemingly
inevitable discovery was wearing on his nerves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; said the doctor, still regarding Don
closely; &#8220;what position did you fill, my son?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>&#8220;I was right half-back,&#8221; came, rather faintly, from
Don&#8217;s lips. Then he took a swallow of milk and choked
over it.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it says here that Smith, the right half-back of the
Rockspurs, took the ball round Highland&#8217;s end for a gain
of twelve yards before being tackled and brought to
earth by Garrison, Highland&#8217;s left half. What does that
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s another blunder of the reporter&#8217;s,&#8221; asserted Don,
boldly. &#8220;He got twisted somehow. Smith is on the
right end of the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad there could not have been a good report
of the game,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;I hope you fellows will
do better next Saturday, for I&#8217;m going to see that game if
I can possibly get to it. You want to remember that I&#8217;ll
be watching you, and brace up, my boy. I suppose you
want to see the account of the game. There it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>He passed the paper over, but it was some moments
before Don could read a word, although he sat staring
at the print, which ran together in a confused mass. At
last the boy&#8217;s brain cleared, and he slowly perused the report
of the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s sloppy,&#8221; he commented, handing the paper
back. &#8220;That reporter ought to write up one more game
of football and then go off somewhere and die. He didn&#8217;t
get half of it correct.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as possible, he left the table and the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ginger! I thought the jig was up!&#8221; he muttered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
hastening away. &#8220;It will be up next Saturday.&#8221; Then
he halted, his hands thrust deep into his pockets, his
eyes fastened on the ground. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be all up, unless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
There was another pause, and, all at once, as if relieved,
he cried: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to do it, that&#8217;s all! If I do, he may
never know I&#8217;ve fooled him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he lost no time in finding Sterndale and informing
him that he had decided to play on the team in the
game against Highland the following Saturday.</p>

<small>THE PROOF AGAINST RENWOOD.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this I hear, Scott?&#8221; cried Leon Bentley, rushing
up to him as he appeared at the academy that noon.
&#8220;They say you practiced with the team this morning. I
was away&mdash;went to see my aunt over at Freeport last
night, and didn&#8217;t get back in time for school this forenoon.
They lie about you, don&#8217;t they? You didn&#8217;t practice
with the team, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What if I did?&#8221; demanded Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, hang it! you said you wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;you said nothing
could induce you to! You gave me fits for going
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re not the only fellow who has a privilege
to change his mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have?&#8221; gasped Leon. &#8220;I never thought it
of you! After all Renwood&#8217;s said, too! You&#8217;ll be chumming
with him next.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scott&#8217;s face grew dark. &#8220;Let up on that!&#8221; he grated.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t take it from you! I hate him just as much as I
ever did!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;ll kick me off the team now,&#8221; said Bentley.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve helped him carry out his plan to do that, anyhow.
I never thought it of you,&#8221; he again declared, with
unspeakable reproach. &#8220;Anyhow, I&#8217;ll bet my money on
Highland, and I&#8217;ve got some to bet, too.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>As he made this statement, Leon produced a roll of
bills, which he flourished before Don, grinning triumphantly.
The doctor&#8217;s son was surprised to see so much
money in the possession of Bentley, but he made no comment,
not a little to Leon&#8217;s disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you ask me where I got it?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;My aunt&#8217;s been keeping it for me, to make me a present
on my birthday that comes next Tuesday. She was going
to get me a suit of clothes, shoes, hat and full rig with
it, but I got the old lady to cough it up to me and let me
buy my own stuff. If I can catch any suckers, I&#8217;m going
to bet the whole pile on Highland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I hope you&#8217;ll lose it!&#8221; exclaimed Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nice!&#8221; sneered Leon. &#8220;But I won&#8217;t. Highland
will have a snap, same as she did before, and it
won&#8217;t make any difference if you are on the team.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not Rockspur I&#8217;m sore on,&#8221; declared Don. &#8220;It&#8217;s
only that cad, Renwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And still you&#8217;re going to play with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a reason for that. You know my father
doesn&#8217;t suspect I left the team, and I don&#8217;t propose to let
him know it. He&#8217;s going to see the game, Saturday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leon whistled. &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s your little game! Well, I
didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d go back, even for that. What do you
care if he does find out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have my father know I lied to him for
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What if somebody told him?&#8221; grinned Bentley.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>Don had the fellow by the collar in a moment. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you dare peach on me!&#8221; he hissed. &#8220;If you do, I&#8217;ll give
you the worst thrashing you ever had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I won&#8217;t say a word!&#8221; promised the frightened
fellow. &#8220;Don&#8217;t choke! Ain&#8217;t I your friend? What&#8217;s
the matter with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Don, releasing his hold. &#8220;But
you want to remember what I said. If it gets to my
father in any way, and I find out who caused it, I&#8217;ll do
just what I said.&#8221; Then he entered the academy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;m your friend!&#8221; whispered Leon, glaring
after Scott with a sidelong look and showing his yellow
teeth. &#8220;I&#8217;m your friend just as long as it&#8217;s any advantage
to be. I don&#8217;t like you. You&#8217;re too ready with
your threats to thrash somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night Don practiced with the team again, and,
as Leon had expected, Carter was given the position of
left tackle, Smith played in his original position on the
right end, and Bentley was left off the eleven. Leon left
the field in a huff, and the boys did better work after he
departed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good riddance to bad rubbish,&#8221; said Dennis Murphy,
as Leon departed. &#8220;Talk about yer hoodoos, begorra,
he&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don practiced with all the vim and vigor he could
command, and during the final brush with the scrub he
particularly distinguished himself in various ways.</p>

<p>When the boys left the field that night confidence had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
returned to them in a great measure, and Sterndale
praised them freely. There had been nothing like a
clash between Renwood and Scott, which had been
dreaded, and every one felt relieved.</p>

<p>Scott was invited to come round to the club-room
that evening, but he declined, saying it was necessary
for him to study. However, he did not do much studying,
for, as he was alone in his room shortly after reaching
home, there came a signal he could not misunderstand.
Some small pebbles rattled against his window
and a peculiar whistle sounded below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, what the dickens does that fellow want?&#8221; muttered
Don, half resolved to pay no attention to the signal.
Then, fearing his father might discover Leon, he thrust
up the window and called down, in a guarded tone:
&#8220;What are you prowling round here for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got something to show you&mdash;something that
you&#8217;ll like to see,&#8221; replied the dusky form below. &#8220;Your
old man&#8217;s gone out; I saw him go five minutes ago. I
have the absolute proof against Renwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don hesitated no longer, but hurried down to let Bentley
in; and, a few minutes later, the boys were together
in Scott&#8217;s room, with the window-shades tightly drawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, where is your absolute proof?&#8221; demanded the
doctor&#8217;s son, eagerly. &#8220;I want to see it. How did you
get hold of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the tail end of a letter,&#8221; said Leon, &#8220;which I
picked up under Renwood&#8217;s desk, where he dropped it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
I saw him drop it, too, and I wondered if it amounted
to anything. I hung round till he left after school, and
then I gobbled it. Here it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>He brought out a sheet of crumpled note-paper, on
which there were a few lines of writing in a clear, bold
hand, and passed it to Don. The page was numbered
&#8220;3,&#8221; and the writing began in the middle of a sentence.
This was what Scott read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;take no chances, so Highland must win again Saturday,
and you must tip me off to any particular weakness of
the Rockspur team, as you did before. I shall expect
a letter from you Friday. Your friend,</p>

<p class="right">P. W.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; cried Don, exultantly&mdash;&#8220;that&#8217;s the proof!
This is the last of a letter to Renwood from Phil Winston,
the Highland coach! Now, I can show the fellow
up to Dick Sterndale, for I&#8217;m going to take this straight
to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; said Bentley, with a knowing grin. &#8220;You
hadn&#8217;t better do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you going to satisfy Sterndale that the letter
this came from was sent to Renwood? Renwood&#8217;s name
is not mentioned. He may simply refuse to believe that
fellow knows anything about it, and you&#8217;ll simply balk
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what am I to do?&#8221; exclaimed the doctor&#8217;s son,
after a moment of silence. &#8220;Sterndale will have to believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
it, that&#8217;s all. If he doesn&#8217;t, he&#8217;s a bigger fool than I
take him to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we might just as well fix it so he can&#8217;t help believing,
even if he wanted to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can that be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s dead easy. I&#8217;ve got some samples of Renwood&#8217;s
handwriting here, and I rather think I can get
up a reply to that letter that will fool anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be forgery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more than the note you took to old Alden. Besides
that, it would be for a good purpose, so there
wouldn&#8217;t be anything wrong in it. I tell you, it&#8217;s the only
way to do Renwood up good and solid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll you do with the letter after it&#8217;s written?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where you come in. The fellows invited you
down to the club to-night. I want you to go down and
drop the letter on the floor, where it&#8217;ll be picked up by
somebody besides Renwood. Whoever gets it will have
to read it to see what it is, which will give the whole
thing away. Will you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Don&#8217;s nature rebelled against such an act, and Leon
saw he was wavering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think what he&#8217;s done to you!&#8221; urged the tempter.
&#8220;He&#8217;s covered you all over with dirt. He&#8217;s made the
fellows believe you slashed the suits and destroyed the
football. It&#8217;s your only chance to get even. Have you
got the nerve?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; grated Don. &#8220;Go ahead and fake up that letter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
I&#8217;ll drop it where it will fall into the hands of Sterndale
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; laughed Bentley. &#8220;Mr. Dolph Renwood is as
good as done for! Bring on the paper, pen and ink, and
watch your old side-partner do the trick. The world is
ours, and Renwood isn&#8217;t in it!&#8221;</p>

<small>THE FORGERY DISCOVERED.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The second bell was ringing when Don entered the
academy the following morning. As he stepped through
the doorway he felt a pull at his sleeves and a well-known
voice whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, did you do it, Scott?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bentley had been waiting for him, and Don saw the
fellow&#8217;s face over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered quickly, in a low tone. &#8220;I got a
good chance last night, for I waited with Sterndale till
after the others were all gone home, pretending I wanted
to have a talk with him. Then, when he didn&#8217;t see me, I
dropped the letter just where Renwood had been sitting,
and I saw him pick it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; chuckled Leon. &#8220;Something will drop on
Mr. Renwood to-day! You did a good job, old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Don had already begun to regret his action, having
found time to think it over soberly when his blood had
cooled somewhat, and he was not at all proud of what
Bentley called &#8220;a good job.&#8221; His hatred for Renwood
had not abated in the least, but his conscience told him
he had made a false step. Had he by any honest means
obtained possession of a letter from Dolph to Phil Winston
in which the Rockspur coach betrayed to Winston<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
the weak points of the Rockspur team, he would have
denounced the traitor openly before the members of the
eleven, backing up his charges with the letter. But, in
a way that now seemed sneaking and underhand, he had
succeeded in causing the letter forged by Bentley to fall
into the hands of the captain of the team, and, even
though he had no doubt of Renwood&#8217;s guilt, he now saw
that he would not stand in a very favorable light were
the whole matter made public. More than that, he felt
that he had, to a certain extent, placed himself in Bentley&#8217;s
power.</p>

<p>Leon, however, troubled by no such prickings of his
conscience, chuckled inwardly as he entered the school-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s found out that the letter ain&#8217;t genuine, nobody
can lay it onto me,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t around the
old club-room to drop it there.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the surprise of both Scott and Bentley, the forenoon
passed without any reference being made to the letter by
Sterndale. The expected exposure did not come, and
Leon was greatly disappointed. He hurried after and
overtook Don as the doctor&#8217;s son was walking swiftly
homeward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure Sterndale got hold of that letter?&#8221; asked
the youthful rascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw him pick it up,&#8221; asserted Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he read it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>&#8220;He looked at it, started, and then quickly put it into
his pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s mighty queer, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; said Leon. &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t he jump on Renwood? He didn&#8217;t say a word&mdash;not
a blessed word!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is queer,&#8221; admitted Don; &#8220;but I think it&#8217;ll come
out before night. He may be waiting to jump on Renwood
to-night when we go up to practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll be there!&#8221; sang Leon, as he skipped off at a
corner on his way home.</p>

<p>Arriving home, Don ran lightly up the stairs to his
room, the door of which he found standing slightly ajar.
When he entered, he was surprised and startled to see
his father standing by a window with a crumpled sheet of
writing-paper in his hand. Instantly the boy felt that
some unusual thing had brought the doctor to that room
just then, and he halted, his face turning somewhat pale.</p>

<p>The doctor, likewise pale, regarded his son with
searching eyes, making Don feel that his very thoughts
were bring scrutinized.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son,&#8221; said the physician, calmly, &#8220;how does it
happen that I find this half-written letter of mine in your
waste-basket? I am sure I did not place it there.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was some seconds before the abashed youth found
his voice, which did not sound quite natural when he
finally spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know, father,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let me see. Oh,
yes! Why, I went down to your desk for some writing-paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
one evening, and that was with the sheets when I
brought them up here. I thought it didn&#8217;t amount to
anything, so I threw it into the waste-basket.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor still regarded his son steadfastly, causing
the blood to mantle Don&#8217;s cheeks, driving away the pallor
and making his face very red. He felt for the first
time in his life that he was not believed by his father,
and the shame and humiliation of that feeling burned
like coals of fire within his swelling bosom. No greater
punishment for his wrong-doing, deception and falsehoods
could have been inflicted upon him than befell at
that moment, when he realized that his father doubted
his statement and had lost confidence in him. In those
few moments he suffered more keenly than ever before
in all his life.</p>

<p>The doctor stepped toward Don slowly, placed a hand
gently on his shoulder, and, in a low voice, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My son, I am very sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he went out of the room and descended the
stairs, leaving the stricken lad standing there, his hands
clenched, his teeth set, his whole body trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows!&#8221; panted the miserable boy&mdash;&#8220;he has found
out about the forged excuse! The jig is up, and my
father knows just what kind of a wretched liar and two-faced
hypocrite I am! Oh, I wish I were dead! I wish
I&#8217;d never been born.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked the floor, his soul torn by the poignant anguish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
that he had brought upon himself by his own false
steps. Fancying he could never again look his father in
the face, he thought of running away, of drowning himself,
of doing anything to escape the mortification of the
ordeal.</p>

<p>Then came a sudden, fierce surge of anger. &#8220;Renwood
is to blame for it all!&#8221; he panted. &#8220;But for him I&#8217;d never
done any of these things, for I&#8217;d stayed on the eleven, and
it would not have been necessary! Oh, how I hate him!
How I hate him!&#8221;</p>

<p>He made no attempt to reason calmly, therefore it
was not possible for him to see the unjustness of his
position. His eyes were not yet fully opened to his own
moral weakness, nor had this exposure unveiled to him
all the pitfalls of the crooked road into which he had been
led by his ungoverned anger and by the craft of a bad
companion.</p>

<p>As he was fuming about Renwood, he heard somebody
leave the house. Hurrying through the hall to the front
of the house, he looked out from a window in time to see
his father pass through the front gate and join a bearded
man who had paused on the sidewalk to wait for him.
The bearded man was Simeon Drew, the deputy sheriff
of the village of Rockspur. The two men walked away
toward the village, Dr. Scott talking earnestly and Drew
listening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, what does that mean?&#8221; wondered Don, beset<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
by a sudden, vague sense of peril. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand
why Sim Drew waited for father at the gate, and I&#8217;d
give a dollar to know what father is telling him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having watched them till they disappeared from view,
he hurried downstairs, where dinner was waiting, and
Aunt Ella was in a state of flustered worriment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; declared the flushed woman.
&#8220;Something has happened that worries Lyman, and he
hasn&#8217;t told me what it is. He didn&#8217;t even wait to eat dinner,
yet I&#8217;m sure he ain&#8217;t going to see a patient.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don did not eat much himself, but, after swallowing a
few mouthfuls, he got away from the house, fearing his
father might return and find him there.</p>

<p>The boys were practicing in the academy yard when
he arrived, nearly all of the eleven having eaten with
great haste and returned. He joined them, but somehow
his work lacked the dash and vim he had put into it the
previous night, his heart being gnawed by hatred for the
quarter-back of the eleven.</p>

<p>It was plain Sterndale had remained silent about the
letter, for Renwood continued to coach, apparently greatly
in earnest, although Don was satisfied that all his
earnestness was false pretense.</p>

<p>Scott found an opportunity to say a word to Bentley
before the afternoon session began.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nice scrape you&#8217;ve got me into!&#8221; he guardedly
snapped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>&#8220;Hey?&#8221; said Leon, showing his teeth. &#8220;What are you
talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About the forgery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgery!&#8221; gasped the young rascal, his face turning
yellowish-white. &#8220;Why&mdash;what&mdash;what forgery? You
don&#8217;t mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that excuse to the professor. My father has
found out about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Leon, with a long breath of relief. &#8220;I
thought you meant&mdash;something else. I thought you
meant&mdash;er&mdash;that letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if that came out, too.
I wish I&#8217;d never had anything to do with you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you did, and you&#8217;re just as deep in the mud as I
am in the mire. You can&#8217;t peach now without giving
yourself away.&#8221; He grinned as he said this, and, with
an angry growl, Don hastened into the academy, fully
expecting to be called up before the professor and questioned
about the forged excuse.</p>

<p>To his surprise, nothing of the kind happened that
afternoon. After school he went directly to the football
field with the others of the team, where the usual amount
of practice was obtained; but Don continued to worry,
which made it impossible for him to appear at his best.
Bentley kept away from the field, and still Dick Sterndale
remained silent about the letter that had been prepared
for the undoing of Renwood.</p>

<p>Puzzled, apprehensive, distressed, Don came down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
from the field and encountered Simeon Drew, who seemed
to be waiting for him. The boy&#8217;s heart gave a heavy
thump as the officer spoke to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t detain ye but jest a minute,&#8221; said Drew; &#8220;but
I want to talk with ye private. Jest come over here to
Robinson&#8217;s barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don followed, feeling both dread and wonder. He
could not understand how the deputy sheriff might be
concerned with the affair of the forged excuse, yet he
feared that somehow he had done something that brought
him beneath the ban of the law.</p>

<p>&#8220;Set down,&#8221; invited Drew, when they were in the barn,
the door of which stood wide open. &#8220;I want to ax ye a
few questions.&#8221; He pointed to a feed-box, while he
picked up a stick, took out his knife and leisurely planted
himself in the most comfortable position possible for him
to assume upon a saw-horse, which he tipped down on its
side.</p>

<p>Don remained standing. &#8220;What do you want of me?&#8221;
he asked, nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to find out what you know about this here
forgin&#8217; business,&#8221; explained Sim, beginning to whittle.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve kinder figgered it out that you know somethin&#8217;, an&#8217;
you might jest as well tell all ye know. It&#8217;ll be the best
thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had come at last, and the boy braced himself to meet
the emergency.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know what you have to do with it, anyway,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; cried Sim, looking up from his whittling.
&#8220;Well, I guess, b&#8217; Jim, I&#8217;ve gut somethin&#8217; to do with it!
I&#8217;m an officer of the law, an&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to &#8217;rest the forger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why you can&#8217;t arrest him for that little thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t? Well, you don&#8217;t know much about law! It&#8217;s
a State&#8217;s prison offense.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don gasped, but he quickly decided that the man was
trying to frighten him, and he forced a laugh, which,
however, sounded faint and unnatural.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know better! It&#8217;s something
for my father to settle with Professor Alden, and you
don&#8217;t have anything to do with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey? Well, by Jing! I&#8217;d like to know what Professor
Alden has ter do with it! It don&#8217;t consarn him nohow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the excuse was given to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The what? What be you talkin&#8217; about? I don&#8217;t know
northin&#8217; about no excuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t?&#8221; cried the astonished boy. &#8220;Then what
are you talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About that check for twenty-five dollars with your
father&#8217;s name forged onto it,&#8221; answered the deputy
sheriff.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />


<small>BREAKING THE FETTERS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Don actually staggered, and for some moments he was
unable to speak a word. To the deputy sheriff the boy&#8217;s
agitation seemed a confession that he knew all about the
matter in question, and so Drew said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The hull business has come out, ye see, so you might
jest as well tell the truth about it. Of course your
father&#8217;ll pertect you, but the other feller that passed the
check over to Freeport will hev to smart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know anything about a forged check!&#8221;
exclaimed Don, in a flutter. &#8220;That&#8217;s the honest truth,
Mr. Drew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come!&#8221; drawled the man. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t no use to
try to squiggle round it. The check come back to the
bank to-day, an&#8217; your father was straightenin&#8217; out his
accounts this forenoon, so he gut holt of it right off.
Reuben Gray, over to Freeport, tuck it, and he sent it
over here by Jeff Lander to git it cashed at the bank, as
Jeff was comin&#8217; over on business. It was jest a happenstance
that your father diskivered it so soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Don understood why his father had looked on
him with such sad reproach after discovering the crumpled
letter in his waste-basket, and the boy was horrified
by the knowledge that the doctor suspected him of participating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
in such a crime. He realized, also, that all this
had come about through his association with an evil companion,
against whom his father had warned him.</p>

<p>Being entirely innocent in regard to the forged check,
Don became both vehement and indignant in his protestations.
It was useless for Simeon Drew to try to coax
or frighten a confession from him, and the deputy sheriff
finally gave over the attempt in disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would hev bin better for ye if you&#8217;d jest told everything
ye knowed about it,&#8221; the man declared; &#8220;but, anyhow,
I&#8217;ll hev the other feller nabbed before night.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Don continued on his way home, his brain in a
whirl over the affair, the whole truth came to him like a
flash of light. He recalled the fact that on the evening
after the football game at Highland, while he was talking
with Bentley in his father&#8217;s office, he had caught Leon
examining Dr. Scott&#8217;s check-book and had angrily ordered
the fellow to let it alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;He tore a blank check from it then!&#8221; palpitated Don.
&#8220;He is the forger! He could imitate father&#8217;s writing,
for he faked up that excuse for me. He went to Freeport,
Thursday, and when he came home he had lots of
money, which he said his aunt had given him for a birthday
present.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everything seemed plain enough in a moment, and he
understood why it was suspected that he had known
something about the affair. Immediately he resolved to
face Bentley in the matter and force the fellow to exonorate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
him. He hurried straight to Leon&#8217;s home, but Mrs.
Bentley, a pale-faced, worried-appearing woman, announced
that her son had not appeared since school that
afternoon.</p>

<p>As Don was departing he found himself again confronted
by Simeon Drew, who had followed him without
his knowledge. The officer looked at him in a stern,
accusing manner that was also full of triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kinder jedged you&#8217;d hurry to tell t&#8217;other feller all
about it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now, you kin see you might as well
own up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never own up to a thing I did not do!&#8221; cried Don.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t make me, either! If Leon Bentley says I had
anything to do with that business, he lies!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; grinned the man. &#8220;He&#8217;ll hev a chanct to
tell his story purty soon. You better go hum and keep
still.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don went home, fully resolved to find his father and
make a full confession of everything. Unfortunately,
Dr. Scott was not there, having been called on a very
serious case, and it was possible that he might not return
until late at night.</p>

<p>Restless and excited, his face flushing and paling by
turns, Don found himself unable to eat much supper,
which convinced his aunt that a serious illness threatened
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that dreadful football,&#8221; she asserted, positively.
&#8220;You&#8217;re all worked up over it. I knew it would make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
you sick, and I told Lyman so. There&#8217;s no sense in you&#8217;re
staving yourself to pieces morning, noon and night the
way you&#8217;ve been doing for the last three weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don might have told her everything then, but it was
hard enough to have to tell it to his father, and he thought
it useless to distress his aunt over a matter she could not
remedy. After supper he went out into the village and
tried to find Bentley, but it was a long time before he
met any one who could give him any information concerning
the young rascal.</p>

<p>The doctor&#8217;s son was not dull, even though he had
been deceived by the crafty Leon, and, in thinking the
whole matter over, he was assailed by a doubt concerning
the genuineness of the portion of a letter that Bentley
claimed to have found beneath Renwood&#8217;s desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;That may have been a forgery, too,&#8221; thought Don.
&#8220;How do I know? I wish I&#8217;d never agreed to do that
other business of dropping the letter to Winston where
Sterndale could find it. Oh, I&#8217;ve got myself into a pretty
mess, and all because I had anything to do with Bentley.
But Renwood is back of it all! He started it! He is to
blame!&#8221;</p>

<p>Always he came round to this mental assertion, but
now, for the first time, he found it was not at all satisfying
to himself. He was struck by the thought that in
this manner he was trying to shift the blame for his own
weakness on to the shoulders of another, which made
him feel mean and small and more wretched than ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>Then he thought of his father&#8217;s story and of Charlie,
who had been ruined by associating with evil companions,
suddenly feeling that the similarity of his position to that
of Charlie when first accused of stealing was something
startling. Charlie had associated with bad boys, but he
had not actually stolen when first charged with theft.
Don&#8217;s father had been taught a lesson by that terrible
experience, and his lips had not harshly charged his son
with participating in the crime of forgery, but his eyes
had spoken quite as distinctly as words.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll not be like Charlie!&#8221; the tortured boy mentally
cried. &#8220;I see my mistake now, and I&#8217;ll have no more to
do with Leon Bentley.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt in a pocket of his coat and found a half-consumed
package of cigarettes, which he took out and flung
away. Leon&#8217;s father and mother were respectable, hard-working,
honest people, and it now began to seem to
Don that somehow all the degraded qualities of the son
had developed under the brain-weakening, conscience-deadening,
manhood-destroying thrall of that opium-tainted
creation of evil, the paper-covered cigarette. Don
wondered now that he had ever been tempted to smoke
one of the vile-smelling things, and wondered still more
that, having found neither satisfaction nor pleasure in
the first one, he had persisted in their use; but he was
thankful in his heart that the dreadful habit had not
fixed itself firmly upon him, though he tried to assure
himself that he would have broken it at any cost of self-denial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
and distress. His heart, however, declared to him
that one of his passionate, impulsive disposition, one who
could not control his fiery temper, would surely have
found it hard to break clear from a habit with such power
to fasten itself on its victims and bind them with chains
soft as silk and strong as iron.</p>

<p>With the casting away of those cigarettes a feeling of
partial relief came to him, for it seemed that he had
broken the unsuspected bond that somehow connected
him with the unscrupulous fellow he now despised.</p>

<p>As he was wandering about the streets, thinking of
this thing and hoping to run across Bentley, he met
Danny Chatterton, who seemed flushed, excited and in a
great hurry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Scott!&#8221; called Chatterton, seeing him. &#8220;Have
you heard the nun-nun-nun-news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What news?&#8221; asked Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;Abub-bub-about Bentley.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don started. &#8220;No. What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s sus-skipped out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Skipped out? You mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s run away. I don&#8217;t nun-nun-know what he&#8217;s
done, but it&#8217;s sus-something cuc-cuc-crooked, and he&#8217;s
run for it. He sus-stole Sus-Skinny Jones&#8217; bicycle and
run away on that. Sim Drew has tut-took a tut-team and
put after him. I&#8217;m going to the cuc-cuc-cuc-club to tell
the bub-boys. Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Don declined to accompany the little fellow, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
Danny skipped away to carry the news to the boys at the
club.</p>

<p>Scott turned toward home, for there was no longer any
chance that he would meet Leon on the street that night.
His father was still away. Till nearly ten o&#8217;clock he sat
up and waited, still determined to confess everything;
but the doctor did not return, and at last Don crept to bed
to spend a wretched night&mdash;the night before the football
game.</p>

<small>ON THE GRIDIRON.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The day, the afternoon, the hour of the game had arrived.
Not even at the deciding game for the baseball
championship between Highland and Rockspur had a
larger crowd gathered to witness the struggle on the
field. The sun was shining, but there was a strong, cool
wind from the west, and the air was as invigorating as a
delightful tonic. The exhilaration of the atmosphere
and the occasion had entered into the hearts of the assembled
throng, which buzzed with expectancy, ready to
laugh, to shout, to cheer, to go wild with enthusiasm over
some brilliant play or plucky stand of the favorites in
the game.</p>

<p>Ropes had been stretched to hold the crowd back, but
they were surged against till they threatened to give way.
It was amazing to see in that small country village such
a great concourse of people gathered to witness a game
of football between two bands of smooth-faced, clear-eyed,
clean-limbed lads. Fathers and brothers and sisters
were there, to say nothing of many mothers, who had
been unable to remain away and who had come to see
their favorite sons struggle like youthful gladiators with
the sons of other mothers, equally affectionate, but lacking
the courage to witness the rush, the clash, the shock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
and tumult of battle in which these lads would hurl themselves
at one another like human catapults.</p>

<p>Highland apparently had sent over nearly all its boys
and girls between twelve and twenty to cheer its
eleven. They had gathered in a compact body on the
bleachers to the left of the grand-stand, and already they
were singing a song of victory, which some rhymester
had composed to the tune of &#8220;Marching Through Georgia.&#8221;
They were prepared for the occasion with megaphones
and crimson pennants and unlimited confidence
in the ability of their boys to win from Rockspur on the
home ground of the latter team.</p>

<p>On the opposite side had collected the adherents and
supporters of the Rockspur Eleven, but, although they
were in the majority, they could not drown the noise
made by the visitors. Everybody seemed good-natured,
and there was bantering and bandying of words.</p>

<p>The grand-stand and much of the standing room to the
ropes was filled with older persons, who, however, seemed
scarcely less excited and eager than the boys and girls,
and who joked with each other and anxiously discussed
the possibilities of the game.</p>

<p>The field lay stretched before them like a white-ribbed
skeleton, the goal-posts rising at either end. It was in
splendid condition, and all were certain that a battle royal
must take place there that day.</p>

<p>Suddenly a new sound arose, and then, as onto the
field trotted eleven shaggy-headed lads, togged in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
football suits, dirt-stained, mud-bespattered garments of
victory, there was a great upheaval to the left of the
grand-stand, and the mass of fresh-faced, youthful humanity
broke into a wildly swaying surge of crimson,
while the Highland cheer sounded short and sharp and
clear, like the barking of hundreds of wolves on a still
winter&#8217;s night.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Rah! &#8217;rah! &#8217;rah! Here we are! High-land, my
land! &#8217;Rah! &#8217;rah! &#8217;rah!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly this was drowned by another sound, deeper,
intenser, more like thunder, as the Rockspur Eleven
quickly followed their antagonists onto the chalk-marked
gridiron. There was another upheaval, mightier than
the first, and the blue-and-white was waving here in a
dense mass, there in streaks, yonder in spots, but all
round the field. The Rockspur cheer of greeting was
like rolling thunder, the rattle of musketry, the starward
hiss of red rockets and the boom of cannon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boo, bum, burr! Rick, rock, spur! Rockspur&mdash;s-s-s-ss!
Rockspur&mdash;boom! Rockspur!&#8221;</p>

<p>How the blood tingled! How one thrilled to the very
finger tips! Carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment,
staid, middle-aged men forgot themselves and their
dignity, and when they realized what they were doing,
found they were swinging their hats and yelling at the
top of their voices, the sound being swallowed up and
drowned in the general uproar. Youth, incarnate, never-dying,
all-powerful, imbued by conscious vigor and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
power, invested with confidence and courage unshattered
by the buffets of Time; youth, the little-prized, the fleeting,
the sadly-regretted, the vainly-sought; youth, the
beautiful and glorious&mdash;it was there, and the great crowd
offered homage to it.</p>

<p>In the lull that followed after some moments of tumult,
a white-haired citizen of Rockspur, who had passed the
three-score mark, flourished his cane in the air and shrilly
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Them&#8217;s our boys, an&#8217; they kin beat at football jest the
same as they beat at baseball, an&#8217; don&#8217;t you fergit it!&#8221;</p>

<p>This caused a burst of laughter, and somebody
shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooray for Uncle Ike! He always stands by the
boys! Give him a rouser, fellows! Ready&mdash;let &#8217;er go!&#8221;</p>

<p>They did &#8220;let &#8217;er go,&#8221; and the cheer for the old man
must have warmed his heart&mdash;that rare old heart that
had never forgotten its youth, and thus, with advancing
years, had found its owner a place in the affections of the
generations that followed him. In acknowledgment of
the tribute he bowed, with uncovered head, and some
dust, or the sun, or something got into his eyes, causing
him to brush his hand across them while he laughed.</p>

<p>Youth once lost may never be regained; but youth
firmly planted in the heart may remain there, though the
body wither beneath the blighting touch of age.</p>

<p>In their heavily-padded suits the boys looked stout and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
stocky. A ball being tossed in among them, they began
to chase it about and fall on it as a sort of warming-up.</p>

<p>Don Scott was there, looking rather pale, his dark hair
and eyes accentuating the whiteness of his face. His
worriment and a restless night had told on him, and his
manner seemed full of lassitude!</p>

<p>Don had not made a confession to his father. With
the passing of the weary night also passed his strength
and determination to reveal everything and seek forgiveness.
He told himself that he was blameless in the thing
of which he was suspected, and time would prove him so;
therefore, it might simply add to his father&#8217;s belief in his
guilt if he told him then of his deceptions and falsehoods.
He resolved to wait until it was plainly proven that he
was in no way concerned with the forgery of the check,
promising himself that he would then make a clean breast
of everything.</p>

<p>So, as much as possible, he avoided his father, which
was not difficult, the doctor being very busy that Saturday
forenoon. Don had expected that Bentley would be
reported in custody that morning, but, to his surprise
and dissatisfaction, nothing had been heard of either
Leon or the deputy sheriff since one left the village hotly
pursued by the other the night before.</p>

<p>As Don paused on the field, adjusting his belt, his eyes
roved over the great throng of people who were roaring
a greeting to the young gladiators of the gridiron. While
flags, hats and hands were waving it was almost impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
to recognize anybody in the crowd, but when the
commotion subsided somewhat, he saw two girls in the
midst of the Rockspur Academy delegation on the blue-and-white
bleachers, and one of them seemed looking
straight at him. Their eyes met; she smiled; she waved
her flag in his direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;That can&#8217;t be for me!&#8221; thought Don, with a little color
coming to his cheeks. &#8220;Zadia Renwood would not do
that for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But then he saw the other girl glance toward him, toss
her head and say something in a spiteful manner to her
companion, which caused Zadia to shake her head and
blush. Then he knew that Dora Deland also fancied
Zadia had waved to him.</p>

<p>The cheering broke out again after Uncle Ike&#8217;s little
speech, and Don looked about for his father. In time he
found the doctor, who was watching his son steadily. The
doctor smiled a bit and waved his hand, but Don seemed
to feel reproach in the smile and it hurt him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll do my best,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Perhaps I may
be able to make him proud of me some way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The excitement was still great when the two captains
drew aside with the referee, who sent a coin fluttering
into the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heads,&#8221; said Walker, the Highland captain, and the
Goddess of Liberty looked up at him from the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your choice,&#8221; smiled Sterndale, as the referee picked
up the piece of silver.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>The wind was now blowing quite strongly from the
west, and the Highland captain immediately selected the
west goal to defend, giving the ball to Rockspur. The
pigskin was placed on the spot in the exact centre of the
field, and the two teams lined up amid another uproar of
cheering and all kinds of noises.</p>

<p>There was a sudden lull. Those two lines of youthful
tigers were gathering themselves for the clash, crouching
a bit, leaning forward, teeth set, muscles taut. Sterndale
eyed the ball critically, settled himself carefully, went at
it and smashed it down the field against the wind with a
beautiful kick.</p>

<p>With the plunk of Sterndale&#8217;s foot against the leather,
which sailed into the air in a long graceful curve, the
uproar broke forth again.</p>

<p>The game was on.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX.<br />


<small>THE FIRST HALF.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Stubby Fisher, the Highland quarter-back, was under
that ball, and he caught it cleanly, passed it instantly to
Walker, who, like Sterndale, was playing full back, and
Walker smashed the oval with such furious force that
Sterndale was compelled to try to take it on the run, the
result being a muff. The Highlanders came surging
down like a flood from a broken dam, but Don Scott was
on hand, and he fell on the ball, while Jack Powell,
Highland&#8217;s left tackle, leaped upon him like a panther.
The ball was down on Rockspur&#8217;s thirty-yard line, but
the home team had it, and there was great cheering from
the bleachers on both sides.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clever, Scott&mdash;clever!&#8221; said Sterndale, approvingly,
as the men untangled. &#8220;The right man in the right
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The players lined up quickly, Chatterton preparing to
snap the ball back. They crouched close together, facing
each other, each Highlander watching his man, each
Rockspurite ready to do his part in handling the ball or
in the work of interference. It was a thrilling spectacle,
and again the uproar lulled somewhat, so that Sterndale
was heard distinctly giving the signals.</p>

<p>There was a sudden, quick movement. Chatterton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
snapped to Renwood, who fumbled and lost the ball;
Highland&#8217;s left guard, Hartford, came through on the
jump, got it, but&mdash;also fumbled. Renwood redeemed
himself by recovering the oval almost before the spectators
could realize he had lost it, and it went to Scott, who
tried Powell and made two yards.</p>

<p>This was football! It was electrifying in its swift
changes. The groan caused by Renwood&#8217;s fumble had
barely reached the lips of the Rockspur spectators when
it changed to a shout of joy on seeing him immediately
recover the pigskin and carry out the captain&#8217;s signaled
directions.</p>

<p>But two yards was not a gain worth mentioning, and
Scott had found Powell there to stay. He felt like immediately
making another try at the fellow, but Sterndale
decided otherwise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boy, Renwood!&#8221; breathed the captain. &#8220;Saved
yourself prettily. It&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dolph shook his head, evidently little pleased with
himself. Again the crouching men were waiting, and
Dick fell back. As the signal came, the ball went flying
back to the big captain, who punted; but it was an inferior
kick, and Garrison, left half for Highland, caught
the leather in the middle of the field, where he was
downed in a flash by John Smith.</p>

<p>Highland began the attack, but it was quickly over, for
Garrison lost the ball on his first plunge into Rockspur&#8217;s
line, having been sent across against Ford, the deaf-mute,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
who seemed rooted in the ground like an iron post, and
Murphy came down on the yellow oval like a load of
rocks, with six men on top of him.</p>

<p>In this savage business Rockspur made no delays. This
time Mayfair was given a trial, and, aided by his interferers,
smashed hard into Highland&#8217;s centre, but was
beaten off. Immediately he went at the visitors&#8217; right
tackle, but two yards was the best he could do, and the
second down left Rockspur with three yards to gain.</p>

<p>Sterndale was given a meaning look by Renwood, who
received a nod, and then Dick called the signal for a
double-pass. A moment later the ball was snapped back,
sent to Scott, and Don started across for Highland&#8217;s right
end. As he shot by Dolph he returned the ball to the
quarter-back, and Renwood darted toward the visitors&#8217;
left wing.</p>

<p>The trick was not successful, however; in fact, it was
disastrous, for Jack Powell came through the interference
like a leaping greyhound, tackled Dolph and actually
carried him back for a loss of ten yards, which gave the
ball to Highland.</p>

<p>How they shouted from the crimson bleachers! They
roared forth their cheer, ending with Powell&#8217;s name;
and the Rockspur crowd was silenced for the moment.</p>

<p>Don had successfully performed his part of the work
in the double-pass, but he was assailed by a suspicion
that Renwood, knowing what was coming, had managed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
to signal the play to Highland and had deliberately permitted
himself to be carried backward for a loss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of his treachery!&#8221; thought Scott, giving the
quarter-back a black look. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand why
Sterndale didn&#8217;t do anything about that letter. The fellow
will throw this game&mdash;if he can.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was little time for such thoughts as these in the
rush and whirl of the game, and every Rockspur man
was eager to know what the enemy would try to do.
They soon found out, for Garrison was sent through
clean to the home team&#8217;s forty-yard line before being held
and forced to take a down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold &#8217;em here!&#8221; panted Sterndale. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let them
cut any deeper into our pasture!&#8221;</p>

<p>The defenders of the blue-and-white responded nobly.
The line was like a stone wall when Morse, Highland&#8217;s
right half, was driven against it. Only two yards were
gained on a try at the home team&#8217;s centre by Walker,
and the oval was down again. The same trick being
repeated, a yard was lost, upon which the ball went to
Rockspur on downs.</p>

<p>Now the blue-and-white bleachers took a turn at
cheering, hoping to give the home boys encouragement
and vim. The flags waved and the megaphones blared.</p>

<p>The rival gladiators were facing each other near the
centre of the field, though on Rockspur&#8217;s territory. It
had been sharp work, but nothing of a sensational nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
had taken place thus far. Sensations were to follow,
however.</p>

<p>Rockspur had discovered that Highland&#8217;s centre was
strong enough to stop the plays that had been aimed
against it, and so the ball was flashed back to Sterndale,
who punted beautifully, sending the pigskin into the
grasp of Garrison; but the Highland left half was downed
almost in his tracks by John Smith, and the referee&#8217;s
whistle sounded.</p>

<p>Then the referee declared Highland had been off side
when this play began, whereupon the visitors suffered a
loss of ten yards, and the ball was carried back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith, you&#8217;re a corker!&#8221; Sterndale found time to say,
and the tall boy who had once been called a hoodoo
blushed in confusion.</p>

<p>Thus far the Rockspur boys had played with a savage
determination that astonished the Highlanders, who, remembering
the last game, counted on an easy victory;
and now the home team began an attack that proved positively
irresistible.</p>

<p>The ball was given to Scott, and, with it hugged tight,
he lowered his head and bowled the terrible Powell over,
making four yards. Right on top of this, he made one
yard through Hartford and Davis, who were playing
strong as left guard and centre.</p>

<p>Sterndale showed his fine white teeth in an approving
way, and the signal that followed told his men he would
make a try on the right end of the enemy&#8217;s line. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
ball came flying back to him, and he smashed his magnificent
body into Sawyer and Dickens, right guard and
right tackle, gaining six yards and setting the entire gathering
of spectators to yelling like wild Indians at a war
dance.</p>

<p>There was hardly a lull, and now came the first hair-raising
play of the game, and Don Scott was in it. Everything
indicated that Sterndale rather foolishly contemplated
a kick, so Highland braced for that kind of a play.
It was a clever piece of strategy to fool the visitors that
way, for Scott was given a third opportunity to show
what he could do, and, with his head encased in some sort
of helmet, which he had adjusted unseen, he took the ball
and dashed off toward Highland&#8217;s right end. Ahead of
him ran a wall of interferers, blocking off the Highland
tacklers with the skill of veterans. With the line broken
through, Scott still sped on. The backs were hurled
aside, and yet he did not stop. Then it was seen that he
would have an almost clear run to the enemy&#8217;s goal line,
and every man and woman and child rose up and
shrieked; but the cries from the crimson bleachers were
those of alarm and horror.</p>

<p>Walker got past Renwood in some way and made a
headlong flying tackle at the runner, but he missed,
though his hands touched Don. Then it seemed that
Highland&#8217;s last hope of preventing a touchdown had
been lost.</p>

<p>The ten-yard line was reached, when from somewhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
Davis bobbed up at the very heels of the runner. He got
one hand on Don&#8217;s arm, and the desperate lad with the
ball could not fling him off, though he tried. That hand
went down as the other came forward, and both fastened
like hooks upon Rockspur&#8217;s right half-back, dragging,
him to earth exactly one yard from Highland&#8217;s goal line.</p>

<p>For some moments it was impossible to hear anything.
A mighty cheer greeted this splendid tackle, but the
Rockspur spectators were mad with excitement, even
though the run had not resulted in a touchdown. Nothing
could quiet them, even though Sterndale made the
request that they keep still.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told ye our boys could do it!&#8221; Uncle Ike screamed;
but his words were not heard by three persons, so great
was the uproar.</p>

<p>Highland prepared to make the most desperate sort of
resistance, while Rockspur was equally determined to
succeed, being overflowing with courage at this moment.
The lines formed, panting, crouching, ready. With a
quick movement, Scott was hurled like a battering ram
against the enemy&#8217;s centre. When the ball was forced
down on the hold, it was just one foot from Highland&#8217;s
goal line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nun-next time we gug-go over, boys!&#8221; panted Chatterton,
who found it impossible to keep still.</p>

<p>But he was mistaken, for not a fraction of an inch
could they gain when Don once more was flung against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
the visitors&#8217; barrier. It was like trying to butt a hole
through a wall of granite.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause. Sterndale seemed to hesitate,
and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>They were at it again. A surprise play had been attempted,
for the ball had been snapped to Morse and
then passed to Renwood, who got it firmly under his arm
and went slamming into the Highlanders. This was their
last chance. They must put the ball over or lose it. And
so, with the aid of a revolving formation, Dolph was
jammed across the line, Don Scott being ahead of him
and pulling him by the collar.</p>

<p>Rockspur had made a touchdown, and the members of
the eleven were leaping and hugging each other, while
down across the field rolled the reverberant, roaring,
booming yell of victory from the side where fluttered and
flaunted one great mass of blue-and-white.</p>

<p>But, despite all he had done, Don Scott&#8217;s heart was
sore. His was the gallant run that placed success within
the grasp of his team, but the lad he hated with all his
heart had, on the third try, been given the ball and literally
rammed over the line. The touchdown was Renwood&#8217;s,
but Don was certain he could have made it just
as well with the aid of that revolving formation, and he
felt that he had been robbed of a right that belonged
to him.</p>

<p>However, despite the fact that he had been assailed
by this feeling, the moment he heard the signal for Renwood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
to advance the ball he did his level best to put
Dolph over the line, and Dolph afterward confessed that,
more than anything else, it was Scott&#8217;s terrific surge at
his collar that dragged him across.</p>

<p>The ball had been carried over at the southwest corner
of the field, and Sterndale punted it out with a beautiful
kick, Renwood catching it directly in front of the goal-posts.</p>

<p>Then came the try for a goal. Having made the touchdown,
Renwood was permitted to hold the ball. He
stretched himself on the ground, with his right side toward
the goal-posts, while the boys lined out even with
his body, but slightly behind the dirt-stained pigskin.
Dolph held the ball with his left hand undermost, his
elbow resting on the ground and his hand lifted a trifle.
The fingers of his right hand steadied the ball on its
upper side, and then, with the utmost care, as if handling
something intensely delicate and breakable, he lowered
his hand to the ground, flattening it out, guarding against
letting the ball touch the ground, which would have given
Highland liberty to charge.</p>

<p>Sterndale sighted along the seam of the ball, which
was uppermost. He drew back his right arm and advanced
his left, his fists clenched. A second later, he went
leaping at it, his heavy toe caught it fair and handsomely,
and the anxious hush that had fallen on the field was
broken by a roar when the oval sailed, twisting and
whirling over the cross-bar and between the goal-posts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
which made the score six to nothing in favor of the home
team.</p>

<p>The crowd felt like rushing onto the field and hugging
the boys, and it was difficult for two men wearing badges
to hold it back. As both sides returned to the centre of
the field, Don looked round for his father and found the
doctor watching him with an expression of great satisfaction
and pride, while Zadia Renwood waved her flag
and laughed in his direction.</p>

<p>But the game was not over; not even the first half was
over, and there was to be a most surprising turn about
in a very few moments. The Highland boys were not
&#8220;quitters,&#8221; and every man wore a ferocious look when
they lined up with the ball at the centre of the field. The
captain had been saying something to some of the men,
and the visitors were ready to give the over-confident
home team a hustle during the remainder of the first
period.</p>

<p>When everything was ready, Walker kicked off, and
again those twenty-two men were leaping at each other&#8217;s
throats like famished wolves. The fortunes of war varied
till, by a splendid round-the-end run, Garrison took the
oval well into Rockspur&#8217;s territory, being brought to the
earth by Sterndale himself. Then Walker booted the
pigskin straight into Renwood&#8217;s clutch; but Dolph fumbled,
and Dow, Highland&#8217;s left end, fell on the ball like a
carload of steel rails. Again it seemed to Scott that Renwood
was playing into the hands of the enemy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>However, though this advantage had been gained,
though the crimson bleachers were shrieking like mad,
though they tried their best men against Rockspur&#8217;s line,
the boys from the hills could not get another foot. Three
times they were held and beaten off, and the ball went to
the home team on downs, which brought a roar of satisfaction
from the blue-and-white and caused the crimson
to groan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get into &#8217;em! get into &#8217;em!&#8221; grated Sterndale, just
loud enough for his men to hear. &#8220;We must do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Five seconds later, the ball was sent to Scott, who, with
teeth set, neck-cords strained, eyes bulging, went across
and round Highland&#8217;s right end for a gain of seventeen
yards. There he was forced out of bounds, and the ball
was brought in and put down for a scrimmage, out of
which another advance was made, which gave the Rockspur
spectators still greater opportunity to breathe freely.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use!&#8221; squealed Uncle Ike, waving his crooked
cane. &#8220;They jest can&#8217;t do it! Our boys won&#8217;t hev it!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was too soon to crow, however, as the blue-and-white
admirers quickly found out. Highland took a
&#8220;brace,&#8221; and the fiercest hammering failed to give the
necessary gain, so the visitors again obtained the ball.</p>

<p>Then a kicking duel took place, in which Walker got
the best of Sterndale at the end, though it was nip and
tuck at first. The visitors having the advantage of the
wind, Walker made the most of it. At the conclusion
of this volleying, Renwood was downed with the ball in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
his grasp on Rockspur&#8217;s ten-yard line, and once more
the fighting was uncomfortably near the goal-posts of
the home team.</p>

<p>The Highland rushers were desperate, and they tore
through Rockspur&#8217;s interference with a fierceness that
could not be resisted. It was impossible to make a gain
by a hard drive at Highland&#8217;s centre, and, fearing to lose
the ball there, Sterndale punted.</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate kick, for the ball flew low and
Powell jumped in front of it. It struck him on the chest
and bounded back over Rockspur&#8217;s goal line. There was
a mad scramble, from the midst of which Stubby Fisher
wiggled out like a slippery eel, and a moment later was
sprawling spider-fashion on the ball.</p>

<p>Then a wild yell of triumph went up to the blue sky
from the crimson bleachers, for the ball was down behind
the home team&#8217;s line and Fisher had it. The players
themselves seemed dazed for a moment, and the faces of
the Rockspur lads were full of dismay.</p>

<p>There was no delay. The ball was not punted out, but
Fisher brought it straight on to the field from the spot
where the touchdown had been secured, although that
made it necessary to try from a difficult angle. The
men lined up, and the stocky little Highland quarter-back
squared himself for a try at the goal.</p>

<p>A sudden hush, a quick twinkling of Fisher&#8217;s short
legs, a desperate kick, and away flew the yellow egg.
Seconds before it reached the posts, as it seemed, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
crowd saw it was a miss, and a mingled yell of satisfaction
and shout of dismay arose.</p>

<p>The ball fell to the ground, leaving the score 6 to 4 in
favor of the home team.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, fellows,&#8221; breathed Sterndale. &#8220;They&#8217;ll
never overtake us now.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was his manner of trying to give confidence to his
men.</p>

<p>When all was ready, he kicked off, driving straight to
Fisher, who passed the leather quickly to Garrison.
Highland&#8217;s left half-back was somewhat flustered, and he
kicked the ball out of bounds at Rockspur&#8217;s thirty-yard
line. Scott had it, and he announced an intention of
bringing it in ten yards for a scrimmage.</p>

<p>Rockspur now endeavored to smash a road up the field
by a series of furious plunges, making ten yards in this
manner; but there the Highland line became rooted, and
Sterndale was forced to punt. Murphy came to the fore
again by nailing Morse on Highland&#8217;s forty-yard line.</p>

<p>But Highland had the ball. Apparently Walker was
getting ready to punt, and that was what Rockspur expected.
Then it was that the visitors gave the home team
a dose of its own medicine by surprising them with a
sudden rush through centre that carried the leather down
the field to Rockspur&#8217;s thirty-five-yard line. Right there
the rush stopped and two mad lunges failed to gain a
single foot.</p>

<p>Then Walker gave the signal for Garrison to try for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
goal from the field, knowing that the first half must terminate
in a very short time. The Rockspur men saw
what their opponents contemplated, and some of them
laughed outright over the folly of an attempt to drop-kick
a goal from such a distance. Every man of the rushers
prepared to try to go through and down Garrison the moment
the ball was snapped, while the Highlanders braced
themselves to hold the enemy in check long enough for
Phil to make a fair try of it.</p>

<p>Again a hush, and then a quick movement and a clash.
The ball flew to Highland&#8217;s left half-back, who took it
with the utmost coolness, poised it carefully, dropped it,
and the moment it rose from the ground kicked it with all
the force and accuracy he could command. Then some
of those panting tigers came through and slammed him
to the earth, but they were too late.</p>

<p>Away sailed the pigskin, turning over and over, rising
higher and higher, a beautiful kick. There was a craning
of necks and an upturning of white, anxious faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s over!&#8221;</p>

<p>Over it was, fairly and beautifully. Barely had it
touched the ground when the referee&#8217;s whistle told the
first half was ended, and Highland had a lead of three
points, the score being 6 to 9.</p>

<small>THE SECOND HALF.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Under the grand-stand the perspiring, blood-stained,
dirt-bedaubed young heroes were being rubbed down by
their admiring friends, while outside the Highland
crowd sang p&aelig;ans of victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll win this game, fellows, just as true as we play
the next half to win,&#8221; said Sterndale, undaunted.</p>

<p>He never seemed to lose courage, but some of those
tired fellows hung their heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;They can out-kick us,&#8221; muttered Rob Linton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if we&#8217;ve found our weakness there, we must
avoid kicking,&#8221; said the captain, guarding his words so
none of the Highlanders would hear. &#8220;Perhaps they
don&#8217;t know how weak we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fool yourself,&#8221; grated Scott, flashing a look in
the direction of Renwood. &#8220;They were informed of all
our weak points before they came to Rockspur to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; demanded Dick, putting
peculiar emphasis on the &#8220;you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don realized that this was something he could not explain,
and so he muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. I know a thing or two, and I&#8217;ve caught
on to some things in this game that ought to be plain
enough to you, Sterndale, if you are not stone-blind.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re all wrong, Scott, and you&#8217;ll find it out,&#8221; said
Dick, positively. &#8220;The sooner you get over that feeling
the better it will be for you and the team.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scott flushed. &#8220;Do you mean to hint that I haven&#8217;t
done my level best?&#8221; he harshly demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it,&#8221; Dick instantly answered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know where we would have been without you. And I&#8217;ve
given you chances enough, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you gave the ball to Renwood on the third try
when the touchdown was made&mdash;and that after my run.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a trick to bother Highland some. Besides that,
you were tired, and I had sent you against them twice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tired! Bah! I was over the line ahead of Renwood,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;d got over at all if you hadn&#8217;t yanked
me across,&#8221; broke in the voice of Renwood himself, who
had overheard Don&#8217;s words by accident. &#8220;I was stuck
fast when you gave that surge and seemed to pull me
right through Hartford. The entire credit of that touchdown
belongs to you, Scott.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was so frank and honest that Don was silenced
for a moment, but he finally muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There the matter dropped for a time, the men receiving
notice to get onto the field again, the ten minutes of
rest being over; but Don had not changed his mind in the
least.</p>

<p>The two teams were given tumultuous greetings by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
their respective admirers, and, as they lined up for the
concluding half, it was observed that Rockspur had not
substituted a man, while three new players appeared for
Highland, being Pell at right guard, Hardoak at right
tackle and McCord at right half-back. It was plainly an
attempt to strengthen the right wing of the visiting
eleven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, git in, boys&mdash;git in an&#8217; win!&#8221; cried old Uncle
Ike. &#8220;Jest show &#8217;em the kind of stuff you&#8217;re made of!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Highland&#8217;s kick-off, and Walker drove the ball
to Mayfair, who attempted to run with it, but was
downed by Pell and Johnson on the home team&#8217;s thirty-five-yard
line. The referee, however, announcing that
Hardoak was off side, the ball was called back, Highland
losing five yards as a penalty. Therefore, it was from
the visitors&#8217; fifty-yard line that Walker made his second
kick, which Carter caught. Once more the game was on
in all its fury, and the tide of battle ebbed and flowed
with heart-breaking irregularity.</p>

<p>Garrison was full of confidence, having been petted and
congratulated and complimented, and seven minutes after
the second half began he made another try to drop-kick a
goal from the field. This time, however, not being favored
by the wind, he missed the goal-posts by two yards,
though he came near enough to give Rockspur something
of a scare.</p>

<p>Sterndale had been nettled by the ineffective kicking
of his team, and, now, with the wind favoring him, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
punted out in a manner calculated to show what he could
do. It was the longest kick of the day, for the ball actually
came down on Highland&#8217;s thirty-yard line. One of
the visitors would have gathered it in, but he was checked
by cooler heads, and the leather was permitted to roll on
over the goal line for a touchback, which counted for
nothing.</p>

<p>Highland suddenly seemed to realize that facing the
wind meant different kind of playing, whereupon a time-killing
game was inaugurated right away. It was not
long before Sterndale saw through this, and he resolved
to give the enemy such hot work that they would find
time-killing would not do.</p>

<p>As soon as the ball again came into the possession of
the home team, Dick sent Mayfair against the new men
in the right wing of the Highland line to try the mettle
of those substitutes. The interference was poor, and
Rockspur&#8217;s left half-back was blocked without a gain.
Again this play was tried, but the result was the same,
and Sterndale was forced to kick.</p>

<p>For a second time the big captain of the Rockspur
Eleven booted out a distance annihilator, and for a second
time Highland permitted the ball to roll across the goal
line, which was foxy and scientific defense, showing that
the coaching of Winston had borne excellent fruit. Only
a small number of the spectators appreciated the quality
of the playing they were witnessing, but the Harvard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
coach saw it with satisfaction that he was unable to express.</p>

<p>With the resumption of play, Walker kicked from his
kick-out line, but the oval went out of bounds and Powell
crashed into Ford, who was trying to pick the ball up.
The mute was stretched out for a few seconds, but he
quickly recovered and resumed his place, a grim look of
mingled pain and courage on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re trying to knock us out,&#8221; thought Don. &#8220;If
they can cripple us, they&#8217;ll have the advantage, and they
know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This made him intensely angry, and his dark eyes
glowed with a dangerous fire. He had hoped that Rockspur
would be able to give Highland a severe drubbing,
for all of the supposed treachery of Renwood, but that
hope was growing fainter as the minutes passed and the
home team gained no decided advantage in the second
half. All through the game Powell had shown himself
to be the most dangerous man to encounter in the line of
the visiting team, and now Don fancied the fellow was
using his brute strength in an endeavor to put some of
the Rockspur players out of the game.</p>

<p>With this idea firmly planted in his head, Scott aimed
for Powell in the very next scrimmage. When the energetic
Highlander attempted to shoulder him aside, Scott
lost his temper completely and struck Powell a heavy
blow on the neck.</p>

<p>Instantly the whistle of the keen-eyed referee sounded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
and, as a penalty for this foul, Rockspur was put back a
distance of ten yards, with an equal advance for the visitors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do a thing like that again, old man!&#8221; exclaimed
Sterndale. &#8220;We can&#8217;t afford it. Hold steady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you see what that fellow is trying?&#8221; palpitated
Don, who already was ashamed of his angry action.
&#8220;He&#8217;s doing his best to cripple some of our men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let him do the fouling,&#8221; returned the captain.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t afford such business.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no time for further words. Scott was
deeply humiliated, for he knew he had, in a burst of ungoverned
anger, done something that seemed to brand
him as a ruffian. And this had happened after he was
beginning to congratulate himself on his ability to control
his passions when he resolutely set about doing so,
for was he not playing football on the same eleven with
the one fellow he hated more than all others in the world&mdash;had
he not done his level best to drag that fellow into
the glory of a touchdown?</p>

<p>Now, all in a moment, he realized that very little credit
was due him for holding in check his hatred toward Renwood.
The scales dropped from his eyes, and he saw it
was to avoid humiliation and shame before his father
that he was on the team, not because he had resolved to
restrain the animosity for Renwood that had leaped to
life within him. Of course his father had seen that
wretched blow at Powell, and Don dared not look in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
direction. He hung his head and was most crestfallen in
appearance.</p>

<p>Before he knew it the Highlanders were smashing
through Rockspur&#8217;s right wing, Powell was upon him,
and then he was trampled down as the whirling mass of
humanity swept on like a twisting tornado. When this
storm had passed, a human figure was seen prostrate and
motionless on the torn and trampled turf.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scott&#8217;s down! He&#8217;s hurt! Stop the game!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cries of alarm went up, the whistle sounded, and several
men bent over Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give him air! Where is a doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Dr. Scott hurried onto the field and knelt by his
son, lifting Don&#8217;s head to his knee. The boy&#8217;s eyes
opened and he gasped painfully, seeming dazed for a
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you hurt, Don?&#8221; asked the doctor, in a
steady voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurt? I&#8217;m not hur&mdash;&mdash; It&#8217;s my side&mdash;and head!&#8221;</p>

<p>The injured lad had tried to start up, but a sharp pain
caught him in his side and his head went round and
round, while a black shadow dropped like a curtain before
his eyes. Blood trickled from his nostrils, his father
wiping it away.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame!&#8221; grated Sterndale, through his clenched
teeth. &#8220;Scott&#8217;s strengthened the weak spot on the team
and made the best record of anybody to-day. With him
out, we&#8217;re beaten!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>These words were spoken low into the ears of Mayfair
and intended for no other, but they pierced that black
curtain and reached the dazed brain of the boy on the
ground, arousing all his wonderful will-power and bringing
him back from the brink of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not knocked out!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Give me some
water! I&#8217;ll play this game out if I die for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Water was placed to his lips, his face was wet with it,
and then he got up, with his father&#8217;s arm about him.
The breathless spectators saw him push that arm off and
step away, staggering a bit, but gathering himself and
growing steadier. Then, after a last moment of hesitation,
the doctor turned away and the players prepared to
resume the game.</p>

<p>The Rockspur yell came over the field, with Scott&#8217;s
name exploding at the end like a huge firecracker. It
was a sound to stir the blood, and it seemed to restore the
right half-back of the home team to complete strength.</p>

<p>Then the game was resumed. Don caught a look of
satisfaction from Powell, and he knew the Highland left
tackle felt that he had evened the score.</p>

<p>The pluck of Scott gave Rockspur new life, the onslaught
of the visitors being checked. But time was flying,
and, as yet, no opportunity had arrived for the home
team to make the coveted score. Highland was fighting
beautifully to hold her own till the time was up.</p>

<p>There were many swift changes, but most of the struggle
took place near the middle of the field, and the hopes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
of the Rockspur spectators fell lower and lower as the
second half waned and drew near a close. With every
sharp play by the visitors the bleachers to the left
of the grand-stand heaved with crimson and shrieked
with joy. The bleachers on the other side tried to keep
it up, but a note of doubt and failing confidence had
crept into the cheering. Old Uncle Ike, however, remained
undaunted, declaring over and over that, &#8220;Our
boys will git there yit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame!&#8221; fluttered Dora Deland; &#8220;but I felt sure
we&#8217;d lose when I heard they&#8217;d taken Don Scott back.
Just see how he lost ten yards for us by striking that
Highland fellow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As it happened, that made no difference,&#8221; said Zadia
Renwood, immediately. &#8220;I think you are unjust to Don
Scott. He has played splendidly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has he done? He hasn&#8217;t made a touchdown.
Dolph did that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After Don Scott&#8217;s run had made it possible. Rockspur
owes to Scott the points it has made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just the queerest girl, Zade!&#8221; exclaimed Dora.
&#8220;You know Don Scott hates your brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a good reason why I should be unjust to him?
Look! look! He downed that Highland fellow that time!&#8221;</p>

<p>Don had been waiting for the opportunity, and, with
the ball tucked under his arm, he shot out from the
midst of the interference, lowered his head and bowled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
Powell over handsomely. He made a gain of ten yards
before being stopped by Walker.</p>

<p>After that, Scott felt a little better, for he had shown
that Highland&#8217;s left tackle was vulnerable.</p>

<p>In the next scrimmage Jotham Sprout was put out of
the game with an injured back, and it was necessary to
fill his place with Thad Boland. Boland had the brawn
to stop the gap in the line, but his slowness was well
known to Highland, and they tried to take advantage of
it, which brought the brunt of the battle on the right
wing of the home team and gave Scott all he could do.</p>

<p>With only five minuses of play remaining, neither side
had scored in the second half, and there seemed no prospect
that a further score would be made.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use,&#8221; said some of the Rockspur spectators.
&#8220;We can beat those chaps at baseball, but they are too
much for us in this kind of a game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Highland had the ball, and was playing to hold it as
long as possible. Don saw this, and he fairly ached in
his desire to get hold of the leather. The ball was down
for a scrimmage, and he pressed up into the line between
Linton and Boland. He heard the signal and fancied he
understood it. Then Davis snapped back to Fisher, and
Highland&#8217;s quarter-back attempted a long pass to Powell,
who had dropped slightly behind the line for the ball.</p>

<p>The play was balked, for right through between Hartford
and Dow shot a pantherish figure, and the oval did
not reach Powell&#8217;s clutch. Don Scott had intercepted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
the pass, and he went by Garrison like an express train
overdue and trying to make up time. But the hopes of
the Rockspur spectators were dashed when he was
brought down by Walker on Highland&#8217;s forty-yard line.
It seemed that the last chance ended right there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t do it, you know!&#8221; sang the visitors on
the bleachers.</p>

<p>Sterndale lost not a second. He tried to get Scott
round Highland&#8217;s end, but no gain was made. Next he
gave the ball to Mayfair and smashed into the enemy&#8217;s
centre, getting five yards.</p>

<p>Once more the Highlanders became rooted. It was
impossible to jar them. Already some of the visiting
spectators were pressing toward the gate, regarding the
game as won by their team, for but one minute of play
remained. Having given up hope, not a few of the
Rockspurites were leaving the grounds, unwilling to remain
and witness the rejoicing of the victorious Highlanders.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boys did well,&#8221; they were saying, &#8220;but they were
outclassed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there was a hush. Something was going to happen.
What could it be?</p>

<small>THE FINISH AND THE BLOW.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>What was up? The Highland spectators watched the
men on the field with languid interest, regarding the
game as safely won. Somebody declared it was &#8220;all over
but the shouting.&#8221; The one who said this already was so
hoarse from shouting that his voice sounded like the
croaking of a huge frog. The blue-and-white was down;
the crimson was aloft.</p>

<p>Don Scott, his breast heaving from recent exertions,
was seen to poise himself securely on his pins, while Renwood
crouched just behind Chatterton, who dallied with
the ball between his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going to try a drop-kick from the field,&#8221;
laughed somebody on the Highland bleachers. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
last gasp of the dying calf.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flip went the ball, but Renwood handled it awkwardly
in his excitement and made a poor pass to Scott. Don,
however, for all of his fiery nature, now seemed calm as
an old-fashioned clock, and he gathered in the quarterback&#8217;s
pass, deliberately turning and poising the leather
while the Highland rushers were fighting madly to tear
their way to him.</p>

<p>The great egg dropped, struck, and then was lifted
with a clean, swinging kick. It flew over the hands outstretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
to stop it, carrying with it the fortunes of this
remarkable game. The hush suddenly became intense as
all eyes followed the oval, which went straight and true
as a cannon ball between the goal-posts and over the
cross-bar. When it struck the ground pandemonium
broke loose, for this beautiful kick in the last minute of
the game had given Rockspur five more points and placed
them ahead, the score being 11 to 9.</p>

<p>The game was won, and Dick Sterndale gathered Don
Scott in his arms and hugged him with a bear-hug, while
the mad crowd bellowed and thundered and the bleachers
to the right of the grand-stand became a heaving sea of
blue-and-white billows.</p>

<p>But there could be no delay, for thirty seconds of play
remained, and the ball was brought back to centre for
Highland to kick-off. With tears in his eyes, Lee
Walker kicked the ball in a half-hearted manner. It was
captured by Mayfair, and then the whistle sounded and
the end had come.</p>

<p>Onto the field poured the roaring crowd, while the
players caught Scott up to their shoulders and bore him
aloft, cheering and singing. Such handshaking, such
hugs, such dances of joy! Everybody tried to reach the
hero of the day. It was remarkable how two girls made
their way through that swaying, seething mass of humanity,
but they did so, and when Don was lowered for
a moment he discovered Zadia Renwood clasping both
his hands and congratulating him. His face burned like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
fire, and he found himself unable to utter a word in response.</p>

<p>Although they felt bad over losing the game at the last
moment, the Highland players congratulated the victors,
ending with a promise to beat them in the third and concluding
game of the series.</p>

<p>Then there was more cheering, more handshaking and
demonstrations of joy, and the boys finally found their
way to the dressing-room beneath the grand-stand, where
scores of admirers were ready to rub them down.</p>

<p>Among the Rockspur players was but one man who
did not seem bubbling with satisfaction and happiness.
Scott observed that Renwood did not seem elated, and
his heart swelled with mingled anger and satisfaction,
as he fancied the fellow had been completely balked in
his treacherous designs.</p>

<p>In the midst of the chatter of voices somebody announced
that Leon Bentley had been captured by Sim
Drew, brought back under arrest and confined in the
village lock-up.</p>

<p>This information re-awoke Don to his own troubles and
reminded him that his father had not appeared to congratulate
him after the game was over. Immediately he
decided that the doctor, receiving information of the arrest
of Bentley, had at once left the field to interview the
captured rascal. This being true, it seemed certain that
he still suspected his son and had hastened to learn from
Leon&#8217;s lips if his suspicions were well founded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>&#8220;He might have waited a little!&#8221; the boy mentally cried.
&#8220;But I suppose he thought we had lost the game anyway,
so he failed to see the finish. I&#8217;m sorry. He&#8217;ll get the
whole thing out of Bentley; but, unless, the fellow lies,
no matter what else he learns, he&#8217;ll find out I had no part
in the forgery of that check.&#8221;</p>

<p>The possibility that, to partly shield himself, thinking
the doctor could not be so severe if Don should be implicated,
Leon might assert that Don was associated with
him in the check business startled and appalled Scott.</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t dare!&#8221; he panted, half aloud. &#8220;If he
does&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What ails you, old man?&#8221; asked Sterndale. &#8220;One&#8217;d
never dream by the look on your face that you won the
game for us to-day. You took that pass splendidly,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saved me the disgrace of making a foozle at the
critical moment,&#8221; said Renwood, coming up with half his
clothes on. &#8220;I owe you thanks, Scott.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You owe me nothing!&#8221; Don blazed, instantly. &#8220;I
rather fancy you would have felt more like thanking me
if I had fumbled your pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dolph turned pale and stared hard at the lad who had
won the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Do you insinuate
that I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I insinuate nothing,&#8221; interrupted Don, hotly; &#8220;but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
think what I like. We didn&#8217;t lose the game to-day, Renwood,
for all of the traitor on the team.&#8221;</p>

<p>There could be no misunderstanding his meaning.
Dolph&#8217;s voice shook as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are insinuating, and I want to tell you now that
if you mean to cast that slander on me, you lie!&#8221;</p>

<p>Don was on his feet, and he had fallen back against the
board wall of the dressing-room. His right hand gripped
something that was standing there, and then the demon
of uncontrollable anger possessed and mastered him.</p>

<p>The next moment, with a stick of wood, he struck Renwood
to the floor!</p>

<small>THE CONFESSION.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>All alone, his face drawn and white, moving like one
in a trance, the hero of the football game went down the
hill. It seemed strange that he was not in the midst of a
throng of admirers, all eager to be near him and bask
in the sunlight of his glory. It seemed strange that not
one of his late companions on the field accompanied him.
But it seemed stranger still that his eyes were full of despair
and his appearance was that of one who had met
crushing and overwhelming defeat.</p>

<p>He had met defeat in his soul, and he knew it; but out
of that defeat was to come the great victory of his life.</p>

<p>He had seen the victim of his cowardly blow carried
away in the arms of horrified friends, his eyes closed, his
face ghastly, one arm dangling limply. The dreadful
picture was before him now, and it sickened his soul.</p>

<p>He knew Sterndale had stopped him outside the dressing-room,
but had stood off without touching him, as if
afraid of contamination&mdash;the same Sterndale who had
hugged him a short time before in the presence of all the
players and the great crowd of spectators. In a dull way,
he had heard the captain tell him what a contemptible
person he was, and he had felt that every word was true.
He had not denied it when Dick accused him of dropping
the forged letter that was meant to destroy Renwood&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
reputation with the members of the eleven. He made no
sign when Sterndale declared he had seen through the
wretched trick from the first, and would have kicked him
off the team but for the disruption another change must
have brought about. When the captain had finished, Don
turned away, without a word in his own defense.</p>

<p>A groan came from Don&#8217;s blue lips as he thought of
his father&#8217;s story and warning, which he had utterly disregarded,
to his complete downfall and disgrace. His
heart was wrung with anguish at the thought that he
had brought another great sorrow upon that father who
had suffered so much, and with that he began to think of
others more than himself. Renwood&mdash;ah! that was the
worst! Just then he would have given his life to undo
that passionate act.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the feller I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; fer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simeon Drew&#8217;s hand dropped on the boy&#8217;s shoulder.
Don looked at the man, who had overtaken him as he
reached the front gate of his home.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have come to arrest me?&#8221; said the miserable lad,
huskily. &#8220;All right; I&#8217;m ready to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t come to &#8217;rest ye,&#8221; denied the officer. &#8220;I thought
you said you was innercent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, by Halifax!&#8221; gasped Drew. &#8220;An&#8217; Bentley said
he was the one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bentley?&#8221; muttered Don, staring at the man, uncomprehendingly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
&#8220;Why, he wasn&#8217;t there! I struck the
blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno what you&#8217;re drivin&#8217; at,&#8221; admitted the puzzled
deputy; &#8220;but I do know that Bentley wants to see ye an&#8217;
hev a talk with ye. He begged me to hunt ye up. I&#8217;ll
take ye in to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s head cleared a bit, but he accompanied Drew
without further words, and soon he was standing before
Leon Bentley, who, wild-eyed and fear-shaken, paced the
narrow confines of his prison, smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you came, Don!&#8221; cried Leon, trying to catch
his hand. &#8220;I was afraid you wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor&#8217;s son refused to permit his hand to be
taken.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he coldly asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look like that!&#8221; Leon whimpered. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been
friends, and I&#8217;ve tried to do you some good turns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done me the greatest possible harm, but I
am willing to forget and try to forgive if you tell nothing
but the truth now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll tell the truth!&#8221; cried the nerveless prisoner;
&#8220;but you must help me. Promise that you will help me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With your father. I think I can fix it about the bicycle,
if I can get your father to go easy with me. I&#8217;m
sorry, and I&#8217;ll try to do better. Please help me with your
old man, Don!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>&#8220;If I promise to try, you swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do all I can, then. I have been accused of knowing
something about that forged check.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t, Don&mdash;you didn&#8217;t know a thing about it!&#8221;
declared Leon, instantly. &#8220;I hooked it from your governor&#8217;s
check-book the night I came over to tell you about
the game at Highland. I had the doctor&#8217;s writing down
fine from practicing on that excuse business, and I forged
the check. Then I didn&#8217;t dare to get it cashed here, so
I took it over to Freeport, where I bought some stuff and
got a man to take the check and give me the difference in
money. He must have got nervous about it afterward,
or he&#8217;d never hurried it back here the way he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don did not even look at Simeon Drew, who was leaning
against the door, wagging his jaws over a chew of
tobacco and listening to every word that passed between
the boys. He was certain now that the suspicion of this
crime would be lifted from him, but there was yet another
thing about which he wished to know the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about that remnant of a letter you claimed you
picked up from beneath Renwood&#8217;s desk?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what does that have to do with this business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have promised to tell me the truth in everything,&#8221;
said Don, grimly. &#8220;If you do not&mdash;if you hold back or lie
about a single thing, I&#8217;ll not speak one word to help you!
Was that remnant of a letter genuine?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted the young scamp, trying to force a
grin; &#8220;I faked that up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don steadied himself on his feet, feeling that the
ground on which he had fancied he stood securely was
dropping from beneath him bit by bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you led me into the dirty trick of dropping that
letter for Sterndale!&#8221; he finally said, harshly. &#8220;You
wished somehow to get me concerned in your low business!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you hated Renwood just as much as I did!&#8221; cried
Leon. &#8220;It was to down him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And failed. Sterndale tumbled to the trick. Is that
all you can tell? Is there nothing more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The manner in which Leon uttered those two words
convinced Don that it was not all, and he instantly said:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you hold back anything, you want to remember
that I will not help you. The truth is bound to come out,
and so you may as well confess the whole business. Is
that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is&mdash;all except one thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about the cutting up of those suits and that football.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don steadied himself again, feeling his last foothold
crumbling, and his voice almost failed him as he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What about that? Speak out, fellow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&mdash;it was a mistake, Don,&#8221; faltered Bentley, keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
his eyes downturned. &#8220;You see, it was this way: Just
before you dropped into the club that night, Renwood
had his knife out. It was on the table when you had that
little jaw with him, and I took it, thinking he wouldn&#8217;t
notice it was gone. He did notice it after you went out,
and we all hunted for it, but, of course, we didn&#8217;t find it.
Later, when they proposed to give Carter a try on the
team, I got mad, for I saw I&#8217;d be dropped if Carter got
on. I told them what I thought and got out. Then I
wanted to do something to get even with somebody, and
I knew Renwood was the one who was trying to bounce
me. I remembered how you thought he was a traitor,
and an idea struck me. I went up to the dressing-room
under the grand-stand and slashed up the suits and the
football with Renwood&#8217;s knife, which I meant to leave
right there, hoping he&#8217;d be suspected; but, just as I finished
the job, somebody came right in by the door and
bumped against me. I couldn&#8217;t see who it was in the
dark, and I tried to jump and scoot. The other fellow
grabbed me, and we had it. You bet I didn&#8217;t want to be
caught in that job, so I fought for all I was worth; but
the other fellow was too much for me, and he had me
down and was choking me to death when I struck at him
with the knife. I didn&#8217;t know it was you, Don&mdash;truly I
didn&#8217;t! I thought I was being killed. You know the
rest; you know how you got the knife and I managed to
slip away. That&#8217;s the whole truth, Don, and now you
must help me, just as you promised you would.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>The listening lad sat down weakly on a box, feeling
that he had been robbed of everything. He beheld himself
in the true light at last, and the spectacle was so
repulsive that he shuddered and grew cold. When he
lifted his eyes, Bentley cowered beneath the terrible look
he received.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; he whimpered once more&mdash;&#8220;don&#8217;t look at me
that way! I&#8217;ve told you the truth, and now you must
help me! Think of the terrible scrape I&#8217;m in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; cried Don, rising and flinging the other off, so
that he reeled up against the wall, his cigarette flying
from his fingers. &#8220;The terrible scrape you are in! Why,
I have killed Renwood!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he went out, Bentley&#8217;s prayers and pleadings
falling on ears that were deaf.</p>

<small>REPENTANCE AND VICTORY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was some time after dark that, having till then wandered
aimlessly about by himself, Don Scott turned in at
the gate of his home, passed up the gravel walk and entered
the front door. His heart felt like a stone within
him, without life even to give a fluttering start when he
found himself face to face with his father, who seemed
to be waiting in the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son!&#8221; cried the doctor, catching him by the arm,
&#8220;where have you been? When I came home, I expected
to find you here to tell me all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t tell you!&#8221; groaned Don. &#8220;I can&#8217;t think
about it! How you must loathe me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor was astounded. &#8220;My boy, my boy!&#8221; he exclaimed;
&#8220;what do you mean? It is you who must shrink
from me, for I have heard how Leon Bentley has confessed,
clearing you of everything. I can never forgive
myself for permitting a suspicion of your possible guilt
to creep into my mind. And they say you won the game
to-day by a wonderful kick after I was suddenly called
to attend a patient. I&#8217;m sorry I could not have been
there, but I&#8217;m proud of you, my son&mdash;proud of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Don choked, beginning to tremble in every limb. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
suffered then such anguish and remorse as seldom comes
to a person more than once in a lifetime.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know, father,&#8221; he said, hoarsely; &#8220;you
haven&#8217;t heard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They told me all about it,&#8221; insisted the doctor. &#8220;And
you had genuine grit to get up and continue playing
after you were stunned. Do you feel your injury much
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not an injury to his body that was giving the
boy such exquisite pain; it was a far deeper wound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t care for that!&#8221; he cried, despair in his
voice and manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you should be happy,&#8221; declared his father, wondering
and perplexed over the boy&#8217;s appearance. &#8220;You
were not hurt as badly as young Renwood. Why, they
had to take him home in a carriage. I met them on the
road, and they had me attend him. It was a bad knock on
the head, and might have caused concussion of the brain,
but he came round all right, and he&#8217;ll be well as ever in a
day or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>The strength went out of Don&#8217;s legs, and he dropped
heavily on the hall seat. Up to that moment, he had
thought Dolph Renwood&#8217;s blood was on his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father!&#8221; he panted, &#8220;is it&mdash;is it&mdash;true? Are you sure
I didn&#8217;t kill him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it is true; he is not seriously injured. But
what are you saying? Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>&#8220;I struck him after the game was over. That was what
ailed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they never told me a word! Struck him, Don&mdash;with
what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A baseball bat,&#8221; whispered the unfortunate lad. &#8220;Oh,
I&#8217;m a bad, wicked boy! I&#8217;m not fit to be your son! I
wish I&#8217;d never been born!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he burst into tears, which, more than anything
else, were compelled by the relief in learning that he had
not the crime of homicide on his soul, and he was shaken
by a perfect tempest of emotion.</p>

<p>The doctor lifted his remorseful son and led the boy
into his private office, closing the door behind them. And
there in the seclusion of that room Don unbosomed himself
fully, holding nothing back, and found relief and
consolation and forgiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I was all wrong; I see it now,&#8221; said Don,
when he had ended. &#8220;Father, what can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must go to Renwood, confess everything as you
have confessed to me, humble yourself and ask his forgiveness.
That is the least you can do. In this there is
one good feature, at least; Bentley&#8217;s story will prove to
the other boys that they were wrong in believing you destroyed
the football and the suits. Will you go to see
Renwood, my son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go, father&mdash;I&#8217;ll do anything! And as long as I
live I&#8217;ll never forget the lesson. I was to blame for everything!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>&#8220;You were to blame in letting your temper get the
best of you, but you were led into wrong-doing by your
bad companion. Now you can see the danger in associating
with such a fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to see Renwood to-night&mdash;now!&#8221; cried
Don, springing up. &#8220;I can&#8217;t sleep unless I see him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, my boy; I think he will be in condition to see you.
Go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Father and son walked to the front door together, the
arm of the former across the shoulders of the latter.
Then the boy went out into the darkness and hurried
away.</p>

<p>Don feared he would not be admitted to see Dolph, but
his fears were groundless. There was some delay, and he
waited anxiously in the hall; then the maid came and conducted
him to Renwood&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>Dolph was there, reclining on a Morris chair, wrapped
in a dressing-gown. He was pale, and there was a bandage
about his head. He looked at his visitor in speechless
inquiry, while Don stood with his head bowed and
his face flushed with shame.</p>

<p>Renwood was the first to speak. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve
come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for I&#8217;m aching to tell you just what I
think of you; but I declare I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d have the
crust to show yourself here!&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice was full of the scorn and contempt which
the persistent injustice of his enemy had aroused to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
fullest extent. The other lad shrank a bit, lifting one
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; he hoarsely exclaimed; &#8220;you can&#8217;t say
anything too mean about me, call me what you like! I
deserve it all&mdash;and more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Renwood was astonished by this altered attitude of his
enemy, but fancied it was fear of reprisal that had
brought the boy who dealt the blow hurrying to see him.
However, before he could say anything further, Don
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I was right in hating you, for I had been
led to believe you a sneak and a traitor. I have a nasty
temper that it has been impossible for me to govern in
the past, but I&#8217;ll master it in the future&mdash;or die! You
have every reason to hate and despise me; but you cannot
hate and despise me more than I hate and despise
myself. I thought I had killed you, and I suffered just
what I merited. But even then I did not know what a
miserable wretch I was till I went to see Bentley in the
lock-up and heard his confession.&#8221;</p>

<p>Renwood&#8217;s wonder was growing, for this humility and
repentance were so genuine that his doubts were dying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bentley,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;They said he had been arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I want you to hear just what he told me.
Will you listen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, as well as he could in his excited condition, Don<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
told of the confession Leon had made; and a change came
over the face of the injured lad who listened, for Dolph
began to see how this repentant boy who stood before
him had been misled by his own passions and by the
deceptions of an unscrupulous and rascally companion.
Don did not spare himself in the least, and he did not try
to shoulder all the blame onto Bentley. When he told of
the forged letter, he was astounded to find that Dolph
knew absolutely nothing about it. Fearing to bring further
discord into the team, Sterndale had told Renwood
nothing of that letter.</p>

<p>Some moments after this, on her way downstairs,
Zadia Renwood passed the door of her brother&#8217;s room.
That door was ajar, so that, glancing in, she saw two boys
standing face to face, the one with his head bandaged
having both hands on the shoulders of the other, and she
heard her brother saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a misunderstanding and a mistake, Scott, that&#8217;s
all. It&#8217;s all right now, and I think we&#8217;ll know each other
better in the future. Let&#8217;s forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Don Scott came down from Dolph&#8217;s room, his
face wore a look of relief that was almost happiness. He
found Renwood&#8217;s sister in the hall, and she let him out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; she said, giving him a happy smile;
&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you and Dolph are to be friends now. I&#8217;m
sure you&#8217;ll like each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alone in the night, Don halted, took off his hat and
lifted his throbbing forehead to the cool wind that came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
off the open sea roaring along the Eastern Shore. The
sky was heavily overcast with clouds, but, as he looked
upward, they broke and parted in one place, and through
the rift he saw a calm, pure white star.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following is quoted from the Highland <i>Register</i>,
published eleven days later:</p>

<p>&#8220;The third and final football game of the series between
Highland and Rockspur was played last Saturday
before a great crowd of spectators in Highland, and the
boys from the coast won by a score of 17 to 12. It was
a fast and furious battle from start to finish, the youngsters
on both sides fighting as if for their very lives and
displaying at times such vim, dash and courage that the
witnesses were aroused to the greatest enthusiasm and
cheered themselves hoarse. Of course, it is greatly regretted
that our boys lost after being trained by such a
thoroughly experienced and capable coach as Mr. Winston;
but Rockspur also had a first-class coach in young
Renwood, who played quarter-back on the team, and the
improvement of the visitors since their first appearance
here this season was something remarkable. Still, it may
be justly claimed that luck had much to do with the result
of the game, for it was Garrison&#8217;s fumble within
four minutes of the close of the game that gave Rockspur
the ball and enabled the visitors to obtain the final touchdown
and goal that cooked Highland&#8217;s goose. At the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
time this accident happened Highland was in the lead,
the score standing 12 to 11.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first half was a battle of giants. Several times it
seemed that one side or the other must make a touchdown,
but something happened to prevent anything of
the kind taking place, and it was a case of taking a desperate
chance after the second down, when Scott tried
a drop-kick for a goal from the twenty-five-yard line.
He made it beautifully, and the half ended with the points
5 to 0 in favor of the enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the second half Highland put some new men on the
field, and one of the substitutes, Hardoak, soon found an
opportunity to show his mettle by going round Rockspur&#8217;s
left end for a touchdown that resulted in a goal, giving
the home team a lead of one point, 6 to 5. But this simply
seemed to awaken eleven tigers from Rockspur, and
the way they tore great holes in the right wing of the
Highland line was heartrending to witness. Whenever
he was given the ball to advance, Scott seemed a perfect
demon of fury, and once he actually made fourteen yards
with half the home team apparently riding on his back
and shoulders. He was finally crushed to the earth by
sheer weight of numbers, but even then he managed to
squirm along for a foot or two before they could pin
him fast. And he finally slammed himself over the line
for a touchdown that netted a goal and gave his team the
lead once more, 11 to 6.</p>

<p>&#8220;At this stage the game was most exciting, for Walker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
was begging his men to take a brace and win out, and
every fellow responded nobly. In a kicking battle Highland
got the advantage, and the ball was held in Rockspur&#8217;s
territory. Then, after several minutes of varying
fortune, Morse found a hole between Ford and Carter
and got over the goal line of the visitors for another
touchdown, from which Walker kicked the handsomest
and most difficult goal of the day. That gave Highland
12 points and Rockspur had 11. Not a great margin,
but the game was drawing toward the end, and it seemed
enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our boys fought for time, but Sterndale&#8217;s men pushed
the battle with a sort of mad fury that it was hard to
withstand. When the ball came into Highland&#8217;s possession
she endeavored to retain it till the finish of the game,
and there was but four more minutes of play when Garrison
fumbled in a scrimmage and Renwood captured the
ball and wiggled out of the squirming knot of players.
He got a fair start, but even then he could not have
made a goal without the assistance of Scott, who was the
only interferer that ran with him. Powell had been doing
masterly work in the way of tackling, but Scott
bowled Jack over and saved Rockspur&#8217;s quarter-back
from being brought to the turf. Walker came next, and
somehow Scott had recovered from the collision with
Powell enough to be on hand and block Lee quite as effectively.
Then the two men went down a clear field,
with all the others stringing after them like a pack of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
hounds and the Rockspur spectators roaring like mad.
Pell had great speed, and it seemed that he was going to
overtake the runner for a tackle, but somehow Scott
looked over his shoulder and got the range of the pursuer.
When Pell leaped Scott sprang sidelong before
him, and it was Scott that the tackler brought down,
while Renwood ran on and crossed Highland&#8217;s goal line
with the ball. From that a goal was kicked, with the final
result as stated above; but it is to the amazing interference
of Scott more than to the run of Renwood that
Rockspur must give the glory for winning the game.&#8221;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
